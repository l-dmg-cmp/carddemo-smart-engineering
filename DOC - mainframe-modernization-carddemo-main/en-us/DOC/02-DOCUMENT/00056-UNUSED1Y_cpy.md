# **UNUSED-DATA Structure Specification**

## Title

- Title Document: UNUSED-DATA Structure Specification

## File

- `\UNUSED1Y.cpy`

## Summary Description

This document describes the `UNUSED-DATA` structure, which appears to be a remnant from a previous version of the system and is not currently in use. It outlines the structure's fields and their intended purposes based on their naming conventions. However, due to the lack of active usage and context, the exact purpose and functionality of this structure remain unclear.

## Version History

- `CardDemo_v1.0-56-gd8e5ebf-109`: August 19, 2022 -  Initial definition of the `UNUSED-DATA` structure.

## Process Description

The `UNUSED-DATA` structure was likely designed to store a collection of data fields, potentially related to user information. However, its current state suggests it is not actively used in the system.

## Requirements to Start the Process

Currently, there are no known processes or functionalities that rely on the `UNUSED-DATA` structure.

## Validations and Rules

No specific validations or business rules are associated with the `UNUSED-DATA` structure due to its inactive status.

## Technical Details

**Variables:**

* **`UNUSED-DATA`:** A data structure that appears to be unused in the current system.
* **`UNUSED-ID`:**  A field intended to hold an identification number, possibly related to a user or entity. (8 characters)
* **`UNUSED-FNAME`:** A field likely meant for a first name. (20 characters)
* **`UNUSED-LNAME`:**  A field likely meant for a last name. (20 characters)
* **`UNUSED-PWD`:** A field potentially designed to store a password. (8 characters)
* **`UNUSED-TYPE`:** A field that might have been used to indicate a type or category. (1 character)
* **`UNUSED-FILLER`:** A placeholder field for potential future data. (23 characters)

## Security

No specific security considerations are associated with the `UNUSED-DATA` structure as it is not actively used.

## Impact on Other Systems

Currently, the `UNUSED-DATA` structure has no impact on other systems or functionalities due to its inactive status.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| UNUSED-ID | String (8 characters) |  Identification number, potentially related to a user or entity. |
| UNUSED-FNAME | String (20 characters) | Potentially a first name. |
| UNUSED-LNAME | String (20 characters) | Potentially a last name. |
| UNUSED-PWD | String (8 characters) |  Potentially a password. |
| UNUSED-TYPE | String (1 character) | Might have been used to indicate a type or category. |
| UNUSED-FILLER | String (23 characters) | Placeholder field for potential future data. |

## Main References

No main references are identified for the `UNUSED-DATA` structure due to its inactive status and lack of context.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Investigation:** It's recommended to investigate further the origins and purpose of the `UNUSED-DATA` structure.
* **Removal:** If confirmed as unused, consider removing the structure from the codebase to improve maintainability. 
* **Documentation:**  If the structure is kept, add clear documentation explaining its history and why it's marked as unused.
