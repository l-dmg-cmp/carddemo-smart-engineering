# User Information Management

## Title

- Title Document: User Information Management - COBOL Copybook Specification

## Summary description

This document outlines the structure and function of the `COUSR01` copybook within a COBOL-based system. This copybook serves as a template for storing and managing user information, essential for tasks like user authentication, profile display, and account updates.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version

## Process Description

The `COUSR01` copybook defines the layout for handling user data. It provides two views of the same information:

1. **Detailed Attribute List (`COUSR1AI`):** This view presents individual user attributes, each with a designated label and storage space. This is akin to a structured form with fields for details like "First Name," "Last Name," "User ID," "Password," and so on.

2. **Alternative Access View (`COUSR1AO`):** This view offers a different way to access the same user information, potentially grouping related fields or presenting them in a specific format. For instance, it might combine the first and last names into a "Full Name" field.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **COBOL Program:** This copybook is designed to be included in COBOL programs, providing the data structure for user information.
2. **Data Storage Mechanism:** The system needs a mechanism to store and retrieve user data, which could be a database or a file system.

## Validations and Rules

* **Data Types and Sizes:** The copybook specifies the data type and length for each piece of information to ensure proper storage allocation and data interpretation.
* **User Identification:** The copybook includes fields for storing unique identifiers like "User ID" and "Password," which are crucial for user authentication and access control. 
* **Personal Information:** Fields like "First Name" and "Last Name" capture basic user details for personalization and record-keeping.
* **User Type:** A "User Type" field likely differentiates between user roles and their corresponding system permissions (e.g., administrator, standard user).
* **Error Handling:** The inclusion of an "Error Message" field suggests that the system has mechanisms for handling and communicating errors related to user data, such as invalid login attempts or data validation failures.

## Technical Details

**Copybooks:**

* **`COUSR01`:**  The primary copybook defining the user information structure. It contains two record layouts: `COUSR1AI` and `COUSR1AO`.

**Data Structures:**

* **`COUSR1AI`:** A detailed list of user attributes.
* **`COUSR1AO`:** An alternative view of the same user data, potentially with grouping or formatting differences.

## Security

* **Password Storage:** While not explicitly detailed, the system should employ secure password hashing algorithms to protect user passwords from unauthorized access. 

## Impact on Other Systems

* **Authentication System:** This copybook directly impacts user authentication processes, as it defines the structure for storing and verifying user credentials.
* **User Interface:** The structure defined in this copybook influences how user information is displayed and updated within the system's user interface.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Data Validation:** While the copybook defines the structure, additional data validation routines should be implemented within COBOL programs to ensure the accuracy and integrity of user information. 
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms within programs that utilize this copybook to gracefully handle potential issues like invalid data formats or unauthorized access attempts.
* **Logging:** Consider incorporating logging mechanisms to track user-related events, such as login attempts, profile updates, and error occurrences.
