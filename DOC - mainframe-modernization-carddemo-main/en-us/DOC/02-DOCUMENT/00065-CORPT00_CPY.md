# **Corporate Report Parameter Input**

## Title

- Title Document: Corporate Report Parameter Input Specification

## Summary Description

This document outlines the specifications for a parameter input process within a corporate reporting system. It focuses on two key data structures, `CORPT0AI` and `CORPT0AO`, responsible for handling input parameters for generating various corporate reports.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial Version

## Process Description

The process facilitates standardized and controlled input of parameters essential for generating various corporate reports. It involves receiving, validating, and passing on key data points like report name, titles, date ranges, confirmation status, and potential error messages. This ensures consistency and accuracy in report generation.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1.  **User Input:** Users need to input specific parameters through an interface, likely a screen or form, within the corporate reporting system.
2.  **Data Structures:** The system should recognize and utilize the `CORPT0AI` and `CORPT0AO` data structures to store and manage the input parameter values.

## Validations and Rules

*   **Data Type Validation:** The system should validate data types entered for each parameter (e.g., numeric values for date fields, single character flags for yes/no fields).
*   **Date Validation:**  The system must ensure entered dates are logical and follow the defined format (MMDDYYYY).
*   **Mandatory Field Validation:** Certain fields, like Report Name, might be mandatory and the system should enforce this.

## Technical Details

**Data Structures:**

*   **`CORPT0AI`:** This structure primarily handles the input parameters in a character format, suitable for direct user entry.
*   **`CORPT0AO`:** This structure seems to mirror `CORPT0AI` but potentially handles the parameters in a format more suitable for internal processing or output.

**Key Fields:**

*   **`TRNNAMEx`:** Captures the name or code of the specific corporate report the user intends to generate.
*   **`TITLE01x`, `TITLE02x`:** Allow users to enter custom titles or descriptions for the generated report, aiding in clarity and identification.
*   **`CURDATEx`, `CURTIMEx`:** Automatically capture the current date and time, useful for report timestamping and tracking.
*   **`MONTHLYx`, `YEARLYx`, `CUSTOMx`:** Act as flags indicating the report's time frame - monthly, yearly, or a custom period.
*   **`SDTMMx`, `SDTDDx`, `SDTYYYx`, `EDTMMx`, `EDTDDx`, `EDTYYYx`:** Capture the start and end dates for the report's data, particularly relevant for custom date range selections.
*   **`CONFIRMx`:**  Likely a user confirmation flag, potentially used to signify agreement to proceed with report generation based on the entered parameters.
*   **`ERRMSGx`:** Reserved for storing and displaying error messages to the user, helpful for identifying and correcting incorrect input.

## Security

While not explicitly detailed in the provided code, security considerations should be paramount. This could involve:

*   **Access Control:** Restricting access to this parameter input process based on user roles and permissions.
*   **Input Sanitization:** Protecting against vulnerabilities like SQL injection by sanitizing user input.
*   **Audit Logging:** Maintaining logs of user actions, including parameter inputs, for tracking and accountability.

## Impact on Other Systems

*   **Report Generation Engine:** This process directly impacts the report generation engine by providing it with the necessary parameters to fetch and format the data accurately.
*   **Data Warehouse:**  The specified date ranges and other filters would influence which data subsets are queried from the data warehouse or operational databases.

## Main References

*   **Corporate Reporting System GUI:** The user interface where users input the report parameters.
*   **Report Generation Engine:** The system component responsible for using these parameters to generate the reports.

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **User Interface Design:**  A user-friendly interface should guide users through the parameter selection process with clear instructions and validation feedback.
*   **Error Handling:**  The system should gracefully handle invalid inputs, providing descriptive error messages to help users correct mistakes.
*   **Parameter Storage:**  Consider how these parameters might be stored for future reference, especially if users frequently regenerate similar reports. This could involve database tables or log files.
*   **Integration:**  Ensure seamless integration with other system components, like the report generation engine and any data sources used for report generation.

Remember, this specification, while detailed, is based on a limited code excerpt. Further discussions with developers and stakeholders are crucial for refining the requirements and ensuring the final product aligns with the overall corporate reporting goals.
