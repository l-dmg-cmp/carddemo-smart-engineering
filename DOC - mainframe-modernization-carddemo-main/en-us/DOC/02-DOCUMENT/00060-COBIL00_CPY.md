## Title

- Title Document: Bill Payment Transaction Processor - Data Structure Specification

## File

- File: \COBIL00.CPY

## Summary Description

This document outlines the data structure for handling bill payment transactions within a COBOL program. It defines how the program stores and organizes information related to each payment, including details like transaction ID, account information, payment amount, and processing status.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version

## Process Description

The COBOL program utilizes a specifically designed data structure to manage bill payment information. This structure acts as a template for holding all the essential details of a bill payment transaction. Two views of the data are defined:

1. **Internal Processing View (COBIL0AI):** This view uses a combination of numeric and alphanumeric data types to represent values like transaction amounts, dates, and account IDs. This format is optimized for efficient processing within the COBOL program.

2. **External Presentation View (COBIL0AO):** This view reinterprets the data for character-based displays, suitable for user interfaces or reports. It breaks down fields into individual characters, allowing for customized formatting and presentation to users.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **COBOL Program:** The data structure is designed for use within a COBOL program and relies on the program's logic for processing.
2. **Transaction Input:** The program requires input data for each bill payment transaction, including details like the account ID, payment amount, and transaction date.

## Validations and Rules

* **Data Type Validation:** The program enforces data type validation based on the defined data structure. For instance, numeric fields would reject alphabetic characters.
* **Business Rule Validation:**  The program may implement additional business rules, such as checking for sufficient balance before processing a payment.

## Technical Details

**Data Structures:**

* **`COBIL0AI`:**  Represents the internal processing view of the bill payment transaction data.
* **`COBIL0AO`:** Represents the external presentation view of the same data, reformatted for user-friendly displays.

**Fields:**

* **`TRNNAMEL` / `TRNNAME[C,P,H,V,O]`:** Transaction name or identifier (internal and display formats).
* **`CURDATEL` / `CURDATE[C,P,H,V,O]`:** Date of the transaction (internal and display formats).
* **`CURTIMEL` / `CURTIME[C,P,H,V,O]`:** Time of the transaction (internal and display formats).
* **`PGMNAMEL` / `PGMNAME[C,P,H,V,O]`:** Program name for tracking purposes (internal and display formats).
* **`ACTIDINL` / `ACTIDIN[C,P,H,V,O]`:** Account ID involved in the bill payment (internal and display formats).
* **`CURBALL` / `CURBAL[C,P,H,V,O]`:** Current balance of the account (internal and display formats).
* **`CONFIRML` / `CONFIRM[C,P,H,V,O]`:** Confirmation flag indicating payment success (internal and display formats).
* **`ERRMSGL` / `ERRMSG[C,P,H,V,O]`:** Area to store error messages during processing (internal and display formats).

## Impact on Other Systems

* **Database/File System:** The program likely interacts with a database or file system to retrieve account information, update balances, and log transaction details.
* **Reporting Systems:** The external presentation view (COBIL0AO) of the data structure facilitates the transfer of transaction information to reporting systems.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|

| CURDATE[C,P,H,V,O] | Character | Transaction Date (display) |
| CURTIMEL | Numeric | Transaction Time (internal) |
| CURTIME[C,P,H,V,O] | Character | Transaction Time (display) |
| PGMNAMEL | Alphanumeric | Program Name (internal) |
| PGMNAME[C,P,H,V,O] | Character | Program Name (display) |
| ACTIDINL | Numeric | Account ID (internal) |
| ACTIDIN[C,P,H,V,O] | Character | Account ID (display) |
| CURBALL | Numeric | Current Account Balance (internal) |
| CURBAL[C,P,H,V,O] | Character | Current Account Balance (display) |
| CONFIRML | Numeric | Confirmation Flag (internal) |
| CONFIRM[C,P,H,V,O] | Character | Confirmation Flag (display) |
| ERRMSGL | Alphanumeric | Error Message (internal) |
| ERRMSG[C,P,H,V,O] | Character | Error Message (display) |
