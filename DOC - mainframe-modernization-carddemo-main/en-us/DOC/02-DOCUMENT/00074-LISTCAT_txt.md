# **CardDemo Application: Data Storage Inventory**

## Title

- Title Document: CardDemo Application - Data Storage Inventory

## File

- File Route: LISTCAT.txt

## Summary description

This document provides a comprehensive inventory of the data files used by the CardDemo application, a mainframe-based system for managing credit card accounts. It outlines how the data is organized, the types of files used, and their storage details.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version

## Brief Description

The "LISTCAT.txt" file acts as a data map for the CardDemo application, revealing the structure and organization of its data storage. It lists all the files used by the application, categorized by their purpose (e.g., account data, customer data, transaction data). For each file, it provides information such as its type (VSAM or non-VSAM), organization (KSDS, etc.), storage location (volume), creation date, size, and the number of records it contains.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. Access to the mainframe system where CardDemo is running.
2. Authorization to view system catalogs.
3. A tool or utility that can read and interpret the system catalog information, such as IDCAMS.

## Validations and Rules

- **File Naming Conventions:** The document implicitly reveals the file naming conventions used by the CardDemo application, indicating a structured approach to data organization.
- **Data Integrity:** The information about file attributes, storage details, and record counts points towards mechanisms ensuring data integrity and consistency within the application.
- **Data Retention:** The document provides insights into the application's data retention policies, as indicated by the creation dates and backup information.

## Technical Details

- **IDCAMS:** The document is generated using IDCAMS, a utility commonly used in mainframe environments for managing VSAM datasets and system catalogs.
- **VSAM:** The prominent use of VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method) files highlights the mainframe nature of the CardDemo application. VSAM is a file management system designed for efficient data access and storage on mainframe systems.
- **KSDS:** Many files are organized as KSDS (Key Sequenced Data Sets), a VSAM file organization method where records are sorted by a key field, allowing for quick retrieval of specific records based on their key.
- **AIX:** The document also mentions AIX (Alternate Index), indicating the use of alternate indexes for some VSAM files. Alternate indexes provide additional access paths to data based on fields other than the primary key.
- **GDG:** The document lists several GDG (Generation Data Group) base entries, suggesting the use of GDGs for managing multiple versions or generations of files, typically used for historical data or backups.

## Security

- Not applicable. The document itself does not contain any security-related information. However, access to the system catalog and the data files it describes would typically be controlled by mainframe security mechanisms.

## Impact on Other Systems

- **Batch Processes:** The document reveals information about batch processes that interact with the data files, indicating dependencies between online and batch components of the CardDemo application.
- **Reporting Systems:** The presence of files containing historical data and transaction details suggests integration with reporting systems that rely on this data.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| File Name | String | The name of the data file. |
| File Type | String | The type of file (VSAM or non-VSAM). |
| File Organization | String | The organization of the data within the file (e.g., KSDS, AIX). |
| Storage Location | String | The volume where the file is stored. |
| Creation Date | Date | The date the file was created. |
| Size | Number | The size of the file in storage units. |
| Record Count | Number | The number of records in the file. |

## Main References

- **IDCAMS Utility:** The primary tool used to generate the LISTCAT.txt file.
- **VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method):** The file management system used by CardDemo.
- **Mainframe System Catalog:** The source of the information contained in the LISTCAT.txt file.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Data Dictionary:** This document could be used in conjunction with a data dictionary that provides detailed information about the fields within each file.
- **Data Management Policies:** The information in this document is crucial for understanding the application's data management policies and practices.
- **System Documentation:** This document should be part of the overall system documentation for CardDemo, providing a reference for developers, administrators, and other stakeholders.
