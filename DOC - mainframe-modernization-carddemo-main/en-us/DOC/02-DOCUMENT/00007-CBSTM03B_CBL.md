## Summary description

This document outlines the technical specifications for the Card Transaction File Processor Subroutine, a critical component within a larger COBOL-based credit card management system. This subroutine serves as a specialized data access layer, responsible for handling all interactions with the system's core data files. Its primary function is to retrieve, process, and update information related to customer accounts, credit card transactions, and associated cross-references.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version

## Process Description

The Card Transaction File Processor Subroutine streamlines the management of credit card transactions by providing a centralized point for file interactions. This subroutine performs the following key functions:

1. **File Access and Management:** The subroutine opens, reads from, and closes four primary data files:
    - **Transaction File (TRNX-FILE):** Contains details of each credit card transaction.
    - **Cross-Reference File (XREF-FILE):** Links credit card numbers to specific accounts.
    - **Customer File (CUST-FILE):** Holds personal information about each customer.
    - **Account File (ACCT-FILE):** Stores details about each credit card account (balance, credit limit, etc.).
2. **Request Processing and Execution:** The subroutine receives instructions from the main program indicating the desired action (open, read, close) and the target file. It also receives specific keys, such as account numbers, to locate the required information within the files.
3. **Data Retrieval and Manipulation:** Based on the received instructions, the subroutine locates and retrieves the necessary data from the relevant files. This data is then returned to the main program for further processing.
4. **Error Handling and Reporting:** The subroutine includes mechanisms to detect and handle potential errors during file operations, such as a file not being found. It reports any encountered errors back to the main program for appropriate action.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Main Program Request:** The process initiates when the main program sends a request to the subroutine, specifying the desired action, target file, and any required keys.
2. **File Availability:** The specified data files (TRNX-FILE, XREF-FILE, CUST-FILE, ACCT-FILE) must be accessible to the subroutine.
3. **Valid Keys:** The provided keys, if required for data retrieval, must be valid and correspond to existing records within the files.

## Validations and Rules

* **Sequential Processing (TRNX-FILE):** Transactions within the Transaction File are processed sequentially, ensuring that each transaction is handled in the order it was received.
* **Key-Based Retrieval (CUST-FILE, ACCT-FILE):** Customer and Account files are accessed using unique keys (customer ID and account ID) to retrieve specific records.
* **Error Reporting:** Any errors during file operations are reported back to the main program using a standardized error code system.

## Technical Details

**Main Functions/Methods:**

* **`1000-TRNXFILE-PROC`:** Handles all operations related to the Transaction File (TRNX-FILE).
* **`2000-XREFFILE-PROC`:** Manages interactions with the Cross-Reference File (XREF-FILE).
* **`3000-CUSTFILE-PROC`:** Processes requests for the Customer File (CUST-FILE).
* **`4000-ACCTFILE-PROC`:** Handles operations related to the Account File (ACCT-FILE).

**Variables:**

* **`LK-M03B-DD`:**  Indicates the target file for the operation.
* **`LK-M03B-OPER`:** Specifies the action to be performed (open, read, close).
* **`LK-M03B-KEY`:**  Holds the key used to locate specific records (e.g., account number).
* **`LK-M03B-FLDT`:** Stores the data retrieved from or to be written to a file.

## Security

* **Controlled File Access:** The subroutine acts as a gatekeeper for sensitive data, ensuring that file operations are performed in a controlled and secure manner.

## Impact on Other Systems

* **Main Program:** The subroutine directly supports the main program's functionalities by providing access to and managing the system's core data files.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| FD-TRNXS-ID | Alphanumeric | Unique transaction ID |
| FD-TRNX-CARD | Alphanumeric | Credit Card Number |
| FD-ACCT-DATA | Alphanumeric | Account data for transaction |
| FD-XREF-CARD-NUM | Alphanumeric | Credit Card Number |
| FD-XREF-DATA | Alphanumeric | Cross Reference Data |
| FD-CUST-ID | Alphanumeric | Customer ID |
| FD-CUST-DATA | Alphanumeric | Customer data |
| FD-ACCT-ID | Numeric | Account ID |
| FD-ACCT-DATA | Alphanumeric | Account Data |

## Main References

* **Main Program:** The primary program that utilizes this subroutine for data access.
* **Data Dictionary:** Contains detailed information about the structure and content of the data files (TRNX-FILE, XREF-FILE, CUST-FILE, ACCT-FILE).

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:**  The subroutine's error handling mechanisms are crucial for ensuring data integrity and system stability.
* **Performance:** The subroutine's performance directly impacts the overall efficiency of the credit card management system.
* **Maintainability:** The code is structured to be modular and well-documented, facilitating future maintenance and enhancements.
