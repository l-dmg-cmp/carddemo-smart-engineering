# CICS User Action Translator

## Title

- Title Document: CICS User Action Translator Specification

## File

- `\CSSTRPFY.cpy`

## Summary Description

This document outlines the functionality of a COBOL program designed for a CICS environment. This program translates user actions on a terminal into specific program functions, acting as a bridge between the user interface and the application logic.

## Version History

- CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68: Initial version - July 19, 2022

## Process Description:

This program captures user actions on a terminal, such as key presses (including function keys) and translates them into predefined program functions. Instead of directly triggering these functions, it sets flags in a shared memory area (common area) to indicate the user's intent. This approach promotes flexibility and maintainability as the underlying program logic can be modified without directly impacting the translation mechanism.

## Requirements to Start the Process:

1.  **CICS Environment:** The program is designed to run within a CICS environment on an IBM mainframe system.
2.  **Terminal Input:** The program expects input in the form of Attention Identifiers (AIDs) generated by user actions on a terminal.
3.  **Common Area Access:** The program requires access to a predefined common area to set flags that represent the translated user actions.

## Validations and Rules:

- **AID Validation:** The program validates the received AIDs against a predefined list of supported actions.
- **Flag Management:** The program sets specific flags in the common area based on the validated AIDs, indicating the user's intended action.

## Technical Details:

**Variables:**

- **`EIBAID`:**  A system variable containing the Attention Identifier (AID) of the last user action.
- **`CCARD-AID-ENTER`**, **`CCARD-AID-CLEAR`**, **`CCARD-AID-PA1`**, **`CCARD-AID-PA2`**, **`CCARD-AID-PFK01`** to **`CCARD-AID-PFK12`**: Flags in the common area representing various user actions like Enter, Clear, PA keys, and Function keys (PF Keys).

**Methods:**

- **`EVALUATE TRUE`**: Used to compare the `EIBAID` with predefined AIDs.
- **`WHEN`**:  Used within the `EVALUATE` block to match specific AIDs and set corresponding flags.
- **`SET`**: Used to set the value of the flags in the common area.

## Impact on Other Systems:

- **Dependent Programs:** Other programs within the CICS application rely on the flags set by this program in the common area to determine the user's intended action and respond accordingly.

## Models:

Not applicable for this specific program as it primarily focuses on translating user actions into flags.

## Main References:

- **CICS Application Programming Guide:** Provides information on AIDs, common areas, and other CICS programming concepts.
- **IBM System/370 Principles of Operation:**  Offers detailed information on the architecture and instruction set of IBM mainframes.

## Additional Considerations:

- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to manage unexpected AIDs or issues with accessing the common area.
- **Logging:** Include logging capabilities to track user actions and aid in debugging.
- **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive documentation of the supported AIDs, corresponding flags, and their intended functions within the application.
