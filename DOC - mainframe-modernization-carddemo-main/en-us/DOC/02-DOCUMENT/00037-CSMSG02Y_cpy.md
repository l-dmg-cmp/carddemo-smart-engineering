# Card System Error Handling

## Title Document: Card System Error Logging Specification

## File

- File: \CSMSG02Y.cpy

## Summary description

This document outlines the structure and function of a critical component within the Card System, specifically focusing on how the system handles and records errors that occur during processing. This component doesn't perform any business logic itself but acts as a standardized error logging mechanism, ensuring that any unexpected issues are properly documented for analysis and resolution.

## Version History

- CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68: Initial version - July 19, 2022

## Process Description

This component defines a structured format for capturing and storing information when an error (an "abend") occurs within the Card System. This information is crucial for understanding what went wrong, where the issue originated, and potentially why it happened.

The process involves populating a predefined data structure (like an electronic form) with key details about the error:

1. **Error Code (ABEND-CODE):** A short code that categorizes the type of error encountered.
2. **Source Program (ABEND-CULPRIT):** The name of the program or system component where the error originated.
3. **Explanation (ABEND-REASON):** A more detailed description of the cause of the error.
4. **General Message (ABEND-MSG):** A user-friendly message associated with the error.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Error Detection:** The system must have mechanisms in place to detect and recognize when an error condition occurs during processing.
2. **Error Handling Routine:** A specific program or code block must be invoked to handle the error and begin the logging process.

## Validations and Rules

While this component doesn't perform data validation itself, the act of logging errors in a structured format implicitly enforces consistency and facilitates analysis. This, in turn, supports the following business rules:

* **Consistent Error Reporting:** Ensures that all errors are documented in a uniform manner, regardless of where they occur within the system.
* **Simplified Problem Diagnosis:**  The structured format makes it easier for technical teams to quickly understand the nature of the error and begin troubleshooting.
* **Improved System Stability:** By halting processing and logging the error, the system prevents potential data corruption or cascading failures.

## Technical details, Variables, and Methods

- **ABEND-CODE (PIC X(4)):**  A 4-character code representing the specific type of error.
- **ABEND-CULPRIT (PIC X(8)):** An 8-character field to store the name of the program or component where the error occurred.
- **ABEND-REASON (PIC X(50)):** A 50-character field for a more detailed explanation of the error's cause.
- **ABEND-MSG (PIC X(72)):** A 72-character field for a general message associated with the error.

## Security

While not explicitly mentioned, the secure handling of error logs is paramount:

- **Access Control:** Only authorized personnel should have access to error logs to prevent information disclosure and potential misuse.
- **Log Integrity:** Measures should be in place to ensure the integrity of error logs, preventing unauthorized modification or deletion.

## Impact of the application on others in the project

This component has a system-wide impact, as it provides a centralized mechanism for handling and recording errors across all programs and components.

## Models

| Name Field     | Type     | Description                                    |
|----------------|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| ABEND-CODE     | String(4) | Error category code                           |
| ABEND-CULPRIT  | String(8) | Program or component where the error occurred |
| ABEND-REASON   | String(50)| Detailed error explanation                     |
| ABEND-MSG      | String(72)| General error message                        |

## Main References

- Error Handling Routines: Any program or code block that invokes this error logging mechanism.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Log Retention:** Establish clear policies on log retention periods, considering legal and operational requirements.
- **Centralized Logging:** Explore the use of a centralized logging system to aggregate error logs from various sources for comprehensive analysis.
- **Error Code Standardization:** Define a comprehensive set of error codes that cover a wide range of potential issues within the Card System.
- **Automated Alerting:** Implement automated alerting mechanisms to notify relevant personnel of critical errors in real time.
