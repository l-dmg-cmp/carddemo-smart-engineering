# **Date Management Toolkit**

## Title

- Title Document: Date Management Toolkit - COBOL Copybook Specification

## File

- `\CSUTLDWY.cpy`

## Summary Description

This document outlines the specifications for a COBOL copybook designed for handling and validating dates within COBOL programs. This toolkit provides a standardized and reusable approach to managing dates, ensuring accuracy and consistency across different parts of an application.

## Version History

- Version CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68: Initial version - July 19, 2022

## Process Description

The Date Management Toolkit, implemented as a COBOL copybook, offers a structured approach to handling dates. It defines data structures to store date components (year, month, day) in various formats and embeds business rules for date validation. 

Here's a breakdown of its functionalities:

1. **Date Storage:** Provides data structures like `WS-EDIT-DATE-CCYYMMDD` to store dates in different formats (e.g., `CCYYMMDD`, `YYYYMMDD`).
2. **Date Validation:** Includes validation rules to ensure that dates are valid, considering factors like leap years and century boundaries.
3. **Error Handling:** Uses flags (e.g., `WS-EDIT-DATE-FLGS`) and result fields (e.g., `WS-DATE-VALIDATION-RESULT`) to indicate the validity of a date and provide error messages.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **COBOL Program:** The copybook is designed to be included in COBOL programs.
2. **Date Data:**  The program must provide date data to be validated or manipulated.

## Validations and Rules

* **Century Handling:**  The toolkit accounts for different century representations to ensure accurate date calculations.
* **Leap Year Logic:**  Validation rules consider leap years when determining the validity of February dates.
* **Data Integrity:**  Strict validation rules help maintain data integrity by preventing invalid dates from entering the system.

## Technical Details

**Data Structures:**

* **`WS-EDIT-DATE-CCYYMMDD`:**  Stores date components (century, year, month, day) in `CCYYMMDD` format.
* **`WS-EDIT-DATE-BINARY`:**  Stores the date in binary format.
* **`WS-CURRENT-DATE`:** Stores the current date in `YYYYMMDD` and binary formats.
* **`WS-EDIT-DATE-FLGS`:**  Contains flags indicating the validity of the date components.
* **`WS-DATE-VALIDATION-RESULT`:**  Stores the result of the date validation, including error messages.

**Variables:**

* **`WS-EDIT-DATE-CCYY`:**  Represents the year in `CCYY` format.
* **`WS-EDIT-DATE-MM`:**  Represents the month (01-12).
* **`WS-EDIT-DATE-DD`:**  Represents the day of the month (01-31).
* **`WS-DATE-FORMAT`:**  Indicates the desired date format (default is `YYYYMMDD`).

## Impact on Other Systems

* **COBOL Programs:** This toolkit directly impacts other COBOL programs by providing them with standardized date handling capabilities.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `WS-EDIT-DATE-CCYYMMDD` | Alphanumeric | Date in `CCYYMMDD` format. |
| `WS-EDIT-DATE-CCYY` | Alphanumeric | Year in `CCYY` format. |
| `WS-EDIT-DATE-MM` | Alphanumeric | Month (01-12). |
| `WS-EDIT-DATE-DD` | Alphanumeric | Day of the month (01-31). |
| `WS-EDIT-DATE-BINARY` | Binary | Date in binary format. |
| `WS-CURRENT-DATE-YYYYMMDD` | Alphanumeric | Current date in `YYYYMMDD` format. |
| `WS-CURRENT-DATE-BINARY` | Binary | Current date in binary format. |
| `WS-EDIT-DATE-FLGS` | Alphanumeric | Flags indicating date component validity. |
| `WS-DATE-VALIDATION-RESULT` | Group Item | Contains date validation results and error messages. |
| `WS-DATE-FORMAT` | Alphanumeric | Desired date format. |

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Localization:** While not explicitly mentioned, consider if the toolkit should support different date formats and conventions used in various regions.
* **Performance:** Ensure the date validation and manipulation routines are optimized for performance.
* **Documentation:** Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for the copybook, explaining its usage and the validation rules implemented.
