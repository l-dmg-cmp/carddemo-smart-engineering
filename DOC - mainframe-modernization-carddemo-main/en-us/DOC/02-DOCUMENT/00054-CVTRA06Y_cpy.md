## Title

- Title Document: Card Transaction Record System - Daily Transaction Record Specification

## Summary description

This document outlines the structure and data elements of the Daily Transaction Record (DALYTRAN-RECORD) within the Card Transaction Record System. This system is designed to meticulously record and organize the details of every credit card transaction, ensuring that information is readily available for processing, analysis, and reporting.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version - CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68 (July 19, 2022)

## Process Description

The Daily Transaction Record acts as a digital logbook, capturing comprehensive information about each credit card transaction. This information is systematically organized into distinct fields within the DALYTRAN-RECORD structure. This structured approach ensures consistency in data recording and facilitates efficient retrieval and processing of transaction data.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Transaction Data Source:** A system or process that captures credit card transaction data (e.g., point-of-sale terminals, online payment gateways).
2. **Data Transfer Mechanism:** A method to transmit transaction data to the Card Transaction Record System (e.g., batch processing, real-time data feeds).
3. **Data Storage:** A storage mechanism to house the Daily Transaction Records (e.g., VSAM files).

## Validations and Rules

* **Unique Transaction ID:**  Each transaction must have a distinct ID (DALYTRAN-ID) to avoid duplication and ensure accurate tracking.
* **Valid Transaction Types and Categories:**  Transaction types (DALYTRAN-TYPE-CD) and categories (DALYTRAN-CAT-CD) should adhere to predefined codes to maintain consistency and facilitate analysis.
* **Data Integrity:** Mechanisms should be in place to ensure the accuracy and completeness of data recorded in the DALYTRAN-RECORD (e.g., data validation checks, reconciliation processes).

## Technical Details

**Data Structure:**

* **`DALYTRAN-RECORD`:** The primary data structure comprising individual fields to store transaction details.

**Fields:**

* **`DALYTRAN-ID`:** Unique identifier for each transaction. (e.g., "TRXN-20241001-000123")
* **`DALYTRAN-TYPE-CD`:** Code indicating the type of transaction (e.g., "PUR" for purchase, "REF" for refund).
* **`DALYTRAN-CAT-CD`:** Code categorizing the transaction (e.g., "GROC" for groceries, "FUEL" for gas).
* **`DALYTRAN-SOURCE`:** Origin of the transaction (e.g., "ONLINE," "IN-STORE," "ATM").
* **`DALYTRAN-DESC`:** Brief description of the transaction (e.g., "Grocery Purchase at Store XYZ").
* **`DALYTRAN-AMT`:** Transaction amount (e.g., 125.75).
* **`DALYTRAN-MERCHANT-ID`:** Unique identifier for the merchant.
* **`DALYTRAN-MERCHANT-NAME`:** Name of the merchant (e.g., "ABC Groceries").
* **`DALYTRAN-MERCHANT-CITY`:** City of the merchant (e.g., "New York").
* **`DALYTRAN-MERCHANT-ZIP`:** ZIP code of the merchant (e.g., "10001").
* **`DALYTRAN-CARD-NUM`:** The credit card number used for the transaction.
* **`DALYTRAN-ORIG-TS`:** Timestamp when the transaction was initiated.
* **`DALYTRAN-PROC-TS`:** Timestamp when the transaction was processed.

## Security

* **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data within the DALYTRAN-RECORD, such as the credit card number, should be encrypted both in transit and at rest to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Access Control:** Strict access control mechanisms should be implemented to limit access to transaction data to authorized personnel only.

## Impact on Other Systems

* **Reporting Systems:** The Daily Transaction Records serve as a primary data source for generating various reports, including transaction summaries, merchant activity reports, and fraud detection reports.
* **Analytical Systems:** Transaction data can be fed into analytical systems to identify spending patterns, track merchant performance, and support business decisions.
* **Auditing Systems:** The detailed transaction records facilitate auditing processes, enabling the tracking and verification of financial transactions.

* **Data Dictionary:** The data dictionary provides detailed descriptions of each field within the DALYTRAN-RECORD, including data types, lengths, and validation rules.
* **System Architecture Documentation:**  Documentation outlining the overall system architecture, including data flows and interactions between different components.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Data Retention Policy:** Define a clear data retention policy for Daily Transaction Records, considering legal and business requirements.
* **Performance Optimization:** Implement measures to optimize the storage and retrieval of transaction data, especially for high-volume environments.
* **Error Handling and Logging:**  Incorporate robust error handling mechanisms and comprehensive logging to facilitate troubleshooting and system monitoring.
