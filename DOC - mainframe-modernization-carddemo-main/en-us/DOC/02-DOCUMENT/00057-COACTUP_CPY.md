# Credit Card Account Update Data Structure Specification

## Title

- Title Document: Credit Card System - Account Update Data Structure Specification

## File

- `\COACTUP.CPY`

## Summary description

This document outlines the structure of data used for updating credit card account information within the system. The file `COACTUP.CPY` acts as a blueprint, defining the exact format and fields required for account updates, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version

## Process Description

This specification details a COBOL copybook, `COACTUP.CPY`, which defines the data structure for credit card account updates. This copybook does not contain procedural code but serves as a template for data items. Programs interacting with account data during updates will use this structure to ensure uniformity and data integrity.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1.  **COBOL Compiler:** Required for integrating the copybook into COBOL programs.
2.  **CICS Environment:** Assumes execution within a CICS transaction processing environment.
3.  **VSAM Files:** Data is assumed to be stored in and retrieved from VSAM files.

## Validations and Rules

*   **Data Type Validation:** Each field in the copybook has a defined data type (e.g., alphanumeric, numeric), which dictates the valid format for data within that field.
*   **Field Length Validation:** Each field has a specified length, ensuring that data fits within those boundaries.
*   **Business Rule Validation:** Specific business rules, such as credit limits or account status transitions, would be enforced by the programs using this copybook, not within the copybook itself.

## Technical Details

**Copybook Structure:**

*   `CACTUPAI`: Defines the input area for account update data.
*   `CACTUPAO`: Redefines `CACTUPAI` to provide a different view of the data, potentially for output or mapping purposes.

**Data Fields:**

*   **`ACCTSIDI`:**  Account identifier.
*   **`ACSTTUSI`:** Account status (e.g., 'A' for Active, 'C' for Closed).
*   **`ACRDLIMI`:** Credit Limit.
*   **`ACURBALI`:** Current Account Balance.
*   **`ACSFNAMI`:** Account holder's First Name.
*   **`ACSMNAMI`:** Account holder's Middle Name.
*   **`ACSLNAMI`:** Account holder's Last Name.
*   **`ACSADL1I`:** Account holder's Address Line 1.
*   **`ACSSTTEI`:** Account holder's State Code.
*   **`ACSADL2I`:** Account holder's Address Line 2.
*   **`ACSZIPCI`:** Account holder's Zip Code.
*   **`ACSCITYI`:** Account holder's City.
*   **`ACSCTRYI`:** Account holder's Country Code.
*   **`ACSPH1AI`:** Account holder's Phone Number (Area Code).
*   **`ACSPH1BI`:** Account holder's Phone Number (Prefix).
*   **`ACSPH1CI`:** Account holder's Phone Number (Line).
*   **`OPNYEARI`:** Account Opening Year.
*   **`OPNMONI`:** Account Opening Month.
*   **`OPNDAYI`:** Account Opening Day.
*   **`EXPYEARI`:** Card Expiry Year.
*   **`EXPMONI`:** Card Expiry Month.
*   **`EXPDAYI`:** Card Expiry Day.

**Note:**  This is a partial list; the copybook includes numerous other fields related to account details, transaction history, and system information.

## Security

*   **Data Access Control:** Access to this copybook and the data it structures should be restricted to authorized programs and personnel.
*   **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data elements within this structure, such as account numbers and social security numbers, may require encryption both in transit and at rest.

## Impact on Other Systems

*   **Account Management Programs:**  Directly impacts any program handling account updates, ensuring data consistency.
*   **Reporting Systems:** Impacts reporting systems that rely on this data structure for accurate information.
*   **Batch Processing:** Batch programs updating account information would use this structure.
