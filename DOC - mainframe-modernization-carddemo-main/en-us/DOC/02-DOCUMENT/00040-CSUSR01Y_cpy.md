# User Security Profile Management

## Title

- Title Document: User Security Profile - Data Structure Specification

## Summary description

This document outlines the structure of the `CSUSR01Y.cpy` file, which defines how user security profiles are stored within the CardDemo application. This is not a program, but a blueprint that dictates what information is stored for each user and how it is organized. 

## Version History

- CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68: Implemented on 2022-07-19 23:15:59 CDT

## Process Description

The `CSUSR01Y.cpy` file acts as a template for creating user records. Each record will adhere to this structure, ensuring consistency and enabling the system to locate and manage user information effectively.

## Requirements to Start the Process

N/A - This is a data structure, not a process.

## Validations and Rules

* **Unique Identification:** Each user must have a unique ID (`SEC-USR-ID`). This is crucial for distinguishing users and retrieving their data.
* **Secure Password Storage:** The user's password (`SEC-USR-PWD`) must be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access. The exact method of storage and encryption is not defined in this structure.
* **Role-Based Access Control:** The user type (`SEC-USR-TYPE`) determines the user's permissions within the system. This controls what actions they are authorized to perform.
* **Data Integrity:**  Adhering to this structure ensures that user information is stored consistently, maintaining data accuracy and reliability.

## Technical Details

**Variables:**

* **`SEC-USR-ID`:**  A unique 8-character code that identifies each user.
* **`SEC-USR-FNAME`:**  The user's first name, stored as a 20-character string.
* **`SEC-USR-LNAME`:** The user's last name, stored as a 20-character string.
* **`SEC-USR-PWD`:**  The user's password, stored as an 8-character string. The method of encryption or hashing is not specified here.
* **`SEC-USR-TYPE`:**  A 1-character code that signifies the user's role and access level within the system.
* **`SEC-USR-FILLER`:** A 23-character reserved space for potential future expansion of the user data structure.

## Security

* **Password Handling:** The document emphasizes the need for secure password storage, but the specific implementation details are not provided here. This is a critical aspect that must be addressed in the system's security design.

## Impact on Other Systems

This data structure is fundamental to the CardDemo application as it underpins user management and security. Any part of the system that interacts with users will rely on this structure to access and manage user information.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| SEC-USR-ID | X(08) | Unique 8-character user ID |
| SEC-USR-FNAME | X(20) | User's first name (up to 20 characters) |
| SEC-USR-LNAME | X(20) | User's last name (up to 20 characters) |
| SEC-USR-PWD | X(08) | User's password (8 characters, encryption/hashing method not specified) |
| SEC-USR-TYPE | X(01) | Single-character user type code (determines access level) |
| SEC-USR-FILLER | X(23) | Reserved space for future expansion |

## Main References

N/A - This document defines a core data structure within the CardDemo application.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Password Security:** The implementation must incorporate robust password hashing or encryption to protect user credentials adequately. 
* **User Roles:** A clear definition of user roles and their corresponding permissions is crucial for implementing effective access control.
* **Data Validation:** Input validation should be implemented to ensure the integrity and consistency of user data stored in this structure.

**Note:** This specification focuses solely on the user data structure defined in the `CSUSR01Y.cpy` file. Further documentation is required for a comprehensive understanding of the CardDemo application's functionalities, security measures, and overall architecture.
