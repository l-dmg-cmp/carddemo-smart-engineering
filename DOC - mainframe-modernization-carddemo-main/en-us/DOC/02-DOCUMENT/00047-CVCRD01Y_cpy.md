# Credit Card System Data Structure

## Title

- Title Document: Credit Card System - Data Structure Specification for Credit Card Operations (CVCRD01Y)

## Summary description

This document outlines the data structure used within a credit card management system, specifically focusing on the information handled by the CVCRD01Y copybook in COBOL. This structure defines how the system stores and accesses crucial data elements related to credit card accounts, customer information, and user interactions.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68 (July 19, 2022)

## Process Description

The CVCRD01Y copybook acts as a blueprint for a data structure within the credit card system. This structure is not involved in executing transactions but rather in defining how information is organized and accessed by the system. 

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Data Item Definition:**  The code defines "data items," which are like containers holding specific pieces of information. For example, `CC-ACCT-ID` is designed to store a unique identifier for each credit card account.
2. **Initial Values:** Some data items are assigned default values. For instance,  `CCARD-AID-ENTER` starts with the value "ENTER", likely signaling a user action like pressing an "Enter" key.
3. **Alternative Data Views:** The code uses `REDEFINES` to allow the same data to be interpreted in different ways. For instance, `CC-ACCT-ID` can be viewed as both alphanumeric (text) and purely numeric.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **COBOL Program:** This data structure is designed to be used within a larger COBOL program responsible for credit card management functions.
2. **Data Storage:** A mechanism for storing and retrieving data, likely a VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method) file system, is necessary.

## Validations and Rules

* **Account Identification:** `CC-ACCT-ID` is crucial for uniquely identifying each credit card account, ensuring that actions are performed on the correct account.
* **Card Number Handling:** `CC-CARD-NUM` stores credit card numbers and can be handled as both text and numerical values for different operations.
* **Customer Linkage:** `CC-CUST-ID` links credit card data to a specific customer, enabling personalized services and account management.
* **User Interface Interaction:** Data items like `CCARD-AID-ENTER` suggest interactions with a user interface, possibly through function keys or on-screen buttons.
* **Program Flow Control:**  Data items related to program names and flags (e.g., `CCARD-LAST-PROG`, `CCARD-NEXT-PROG`) indicate mechanisms for managing the flow of operations within the system.

## Technical Details

**Variables:**

* **`CC-ACCT-ID`:** A unique identifier for a credit card account (11 characters).
* **`CC-CARD-NUM`:**  The credit card number (16 characters).
* **`CC-CUST-ID`:** A unique identifier for the customer associated with the credit card (9 characters).
* **`CCARD-AID-ENTER`, `CCARD-AID-CLEAR`, etc.:** Likely represent user interface actions or states (e.g., pressing "Enter," "Clear").
* **`CCARD-LAST-PROG`, `CCARD-NEXT-PROG`:**  Store the names of programs, suggesting navigation or process flow within the system.
* **`CCARD-RETURN-FLAG`:** A flag (likely '1' for on, some other value for off) indicating whether to return to a previous operation or program.

**Methods:**

* **`REDEFINES`:**  A COBOL clause used to provide alternative interpretations of the same data.

## Impact on Other Systems

* **Account Management:**  The data structure is essential for core account management functions, including account creation, updates, and retrieval.
* **Transaction Processing:**  Credit card transactions rely on the accurate identification of accounts and card numbers provided by this structure.
* **Customer Relationship Management (CRM):**  Customer-related data facilitates personalized services and communication.
* **Reporting and Analytics:**  The structured data enables the generation of reports on account activity, customer behavior, and system performance.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| CC-ACCT-ID | Alphanumeric (X) / Numeric (9) | Unique identifier for a credit card account (11 characters) |
| CC-CARD-NUM | Alphanumeric (X) / Numeric (9) | Credit card number (16 characters) |
| CC-CUST-ID | Alphanumeric (X) / Numeric (9) | Unique identifier for the customer (9 characters) |
| CCARD-AID-ENTER | Alphanumeric (X) | Likely represents a user pressing an "Enter" key |
| CCARD-AID-CLEAR | Alphanumeric (X) | Likely represents a user pressing a "Clear" key |
| CCARD-LAST-PROG | Alphanumeric (X) | Stores the name of the previously executed program (8 characters) |
| CCARD-NEXT-PROG | Alphanumeric (X) | Stores the name of the program to be executed next (8 characters) |
| CCARD-RETURN-FLAG | Alphanumeric (X) | A flag indicating whether to return to a previous program or operation |
