# **Card Data File Processor**

## Title

- Title Document: CardDemo Application - Card Data File Batch Processor Specification

## Summary Description

This document outlines the specifications for the "CBACT02C" program, a batch processing component within the CardDemo application. This program is responsible for sequentially reading and displaying credit card information stored in a VSAM KSDS file named "CARDFILE".

## Version History

- Version CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68: Initial version - July 19, 2022

## Process Description

The CBACT02C program performs the following actions:

1. **File Opening:** Opens the "CARDFILE" for reading.
2. **Data Reading:** Sequentially reads each record from the "CARDFILE".
3. **Data Display:** Displays the content of each read record. The output destination (screen or printer) is not explicitly defined in the provided code.
4. **Error Handling:** Implements error handling routines to manage issues encountered during file access or data reading. Specific error messages are displayed, and the program may terminate abnormally in case of severe errors.
5. **File Closing:** Closes the "CARDFILE" upon successful processing of all records or occurrence of an error.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **CARDFILE:** A VSAM KSDS file named "CARDFILE" containing credit card data. The file structure and record layout should conform to the program's expectations.
2. **Execution Environment:** A mainframe environment capable of executing COBOL programs and interacting with VSAM datasets.

## Validations and Rules

* **Sequential Processing:** The program processes credit card records sequentially in the order they are stored in the "CARDFILE".
* **Error Reporting:** Any issues encountered during file access or data reading operations are reported with descriptive error messages, facilitating problem diagnosis and resolution.
* **Data Integrity:** The program prioritizes data integrity by ensuring proper opening and closing of the "CARDFILE", minimizing the risk of data corruption or loss.

## Technical Details

**Main Program:**

* **`CBACT02C`:** The main COBOL program responsible for executing the card data file reading and display process.

**Main Functions/Paragraphs:**

* **`1000-CARDFILE-GET-NEXT`:** Reads the next record from the "CARDFILE".
* **`0000-CARDFILE-OPEN`:** Opens the "CARDFILE" for input operations.
* **`9000-CARDFILE-CLOSE`:** Closes the "CARDFILE".
* **`9999-ABEND-PROGRAM`:** Terminates the program abnormally in case of severe errors.
* **`9910-DISPLAY-IO-STATUS`:** Displays the file status information.

**Variables:**

* **`CARDFILE-STATUS`:** A two-byte field containing the file status code returned after each I/O operation on the "CARDFILE".
* **`END-OF-FILE`:** A flag indicating whether the end of the "CARDFILE" has been reached.
* **`CARD-RECORD`:** A data structure holding the content of the current credit card record read from the "CARDFILE".

## Security

* **Not Applicable:** The provided code snippet does not contain any specific security-related logic or functionalities.

## Impact on Other Systems

* **Minimal:** The program's impact on other systems is limited to reading data from the "CARDFILE". It does not directly interact with or modify any other system or application.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| FD-CARD-NUM | PIC X(16) | Credit card number. |
| FD-CARD-DATA | PIC X(134) | Remaining credit card data (details not specified in the provided code). |

## Main References

* **VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method):** The file management system used for storing and accessing the "CARDFILE".
* **COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language):** The programming language used to write the "CBACT02C" program.
* **JCL (Job Control Language):** Used for defining and managing batch jobs in a mainframe environment (not directly included in the code snippet, but implicitly required for program execution).
