# **User Management Screen**

## Title

- Title Document: User Management Screen Specification

## File

- `\COUSR00.CPY`

## Summary description

This document outlines the specifications for a user management screen within a larger application. This screen will be the primary interface for administrators to view, select, and potentially manage user information. This specification focuses on how user data is organized and presented on the screen, rather than the specific actions an administrator can take (e.g., add, update, delete).

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version

## Process Description

The User Management Screen provides a tabular view of user information. Administrators can use this screen to:

1. **View User Details:** The screen displays a list of users with their User ID, First Name, Last Name, and User Type.
2. **Select Users:** Each user row includes a selection flag (likely a checkbox) allowing administrators to select one or multiple users for further actions.
3. **System Information:** The screen also displays system-level information, including the transaction name, program name, current date, current time, and page number. This contextual information aids in tracking and auditing user management activities.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **User Data:** The screen requires access to user data, likely stored in a file or database.
2. **Administrator Privileges:** Only authorized administrators should have access to this screen.

## Validations and Rules

* **Data Population:** The screen should accurately retrieve and display user data from the underlying storage mechanism.
* **Data Formatting:** Dates and times should be presented in a user-friendly format.
* **Data Integrity:** User IDs should be unique, preventing duplicate entries.

## Technical Details

**Main Data Structure:**

* **`COUSR00`:** This structure defines the layout for both input (`COUSR0AI`) and output (`COUSR0AO`) data related to the screen.

**Fields:**

* **`USRID`:** Unique identifier for each user.
* **`FNAME`:** User's first name.
* **`LNAME`:** User's last name.
* **`UTYPE`:** Code indicating the user's role (e.g., administrator, standard user).
* **`SEL####`:** Selection flags (checkboxes) for each user row.
* **`TRNNAM`:** Transaction name.
* **`PGMNAM`:** Program name.
* **`CURDAT`:** Current date.
* **`CURTIM`:** Current time.
* **`PAGENU`:** Page number.

## Security

* **Access Control:** Access to this screen should be restricted to authorized administrators.

## Impact on Other Systems

* **User Management Processes:** This screen is a core component for user management functionalities, providing the interface for administrators to interact with user data.
