# User Account Management System

## Title

- Title Document: User Account Management System - Data Structure Specification

## Summary Description

This document details the structure of user account information within a larger system. This structure defines how user data is organized and stored, serving as a blueprint for managing user accounts in a secure and efficient manner.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version

## Process Description

The `COUSR2` data structure defines the layout for storing user account information. It includes fields for storing user ID, password, personal details like first and last names, user type (e.g., administrator, regular user), and system-related information like timestamps and error messages.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Data Storage Mechanism:** A defined method for storing and retrieving data, such as a database or file system.
2. **Character Encoding Standard:** A consistent character encoding standard (e.g., ASCII, EBCDIC) to ensure data integrity across different systems.

## Validations and Rules

* **Data Type Validation:** Ensure that data entered into each field adheres to the defined data type (e.g., alphanumeric for user ID, numeric for timestamps).
* **Data Length Validation:** Enforce maximum lengths for data fields to prevent truncation and maintain data consistency.
* **Password Complexity:** Implement rules for password complexity (e.g., minimum length, use of special characters) to enhance security.
* **User Type Validation:** Define valid user types and ensure that only authorized personnel can assign user roles.

## Technical Details

**Data Structures:**

* **`COUSR2AI`:** Defines the user account information layout using a specific character encoding scheme.
* **`COUSR2AO`:** Provides an alternative layout for the same user account information using a different character encoding scheme, allowing flexibility for system integration.

**Data Fields:**

* **`USRIDIN`:** Unique identifier for each user account.
* **`PASSWD`:**  Password associated with the user account for authentication.
* **`FNAME`:** User's first name.
* **`LNAME`:** User's last name.
* **`USRTYPE`:**  Defines the user's role and access privileges within the system (e.g., 'A' for administrator, 'U' for regular user).
* **`TRNNAME`:** Captures the transaction name or code associated with a particular user action or event.
* **`CURDATE`:**  Stores the current date, providing a timestamp for user-related activities.
* **`CURTIME`:** Stores the current time, further detailing when user actions occur.
* **`PGMNAME`:** Records the name of the program or module being accessed or used by the user.
* **`TITLE01`, `TITLE02`:**  Can be used for storing descriptive titles or labels related to the user or their actions.
* **`ERRMSG`:**  Stores error messages generated during user interactions, aiding in troubleshooting and system monitoring.

## Security

* **Password Storage:** Do **not** store passwords in plain text. Implement secure password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, scrypt) to protect passwords from unauthorized access.
* **Data Encryption:** Consider encrypting sensitive user data, both in transit and at rest, to further enhance security.
* **Access Control:**  Strictly control access to user account information based on user roles and privileges.

## Impact on Other Systems

* **Authentication System:** This data structure is crucial for user authentication, allowing the system to verify user credentials.
* **Authorization System:** User type information is essential for enforcing access control, ensuring that users have appropriate permissions.
* **Auditing System:** Timestamps and user IDs facilitate audit trails, tracking user actions and system events.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| USRIDIN | Alphanumeric | Unique user ID (e.g., employee number, username). |
| PASSWD | Alphanumeric | User's password (hashed and salted for security). |
| FNAME | Alphanumeric | User's first name. |
| LNAME | Alphanumeric | User's last name. |
| USRTYPE | Alphanumeric | Single-character code representing user type (e.g., 'A', 'U'). |
| TRNNAME | Alphanumeric | Transaction name or code. |
| CURDATE | Numeric | Current date in YYYYMMDD format. |
| CURTIME | Numeric | Current time in HHMMSS format. |
| PGMNAME | Alphanumeric | Program or module name. |
| TITLE01 | Alphanumeric | Descriptive title or label. |
| TITLE02 | Alphanumeric | Descriptive title or label. |
| ERRMSG | Alphanumeric | Error message. |
