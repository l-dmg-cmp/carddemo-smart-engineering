# Credit Card Tracking System

## Title

- Title Document: Credit Card Tracking System - Card Index Management API Specification

## Summary description

This document outlines the requirements for a Credit Card Tracking System API, focusing specifically on the management of the card index. This API serves as an intermediary between a user interface (like a web application) and the backend systems responsible for storing and managing credit card data. The primary function of this API is to provide a streamlined way to access and interpret information stored in the `cardxref.txt` file, which acts as a central index for all credit cards within the system. 

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version

## Process Description

The Card Index Management API facilitates the retrieval and interpretation of data stored within the `cardxref.txt` file. The API interacts with the file system to perform the following actions:

1. **Retrieve Card Index Data:** The API reads the `cardxref.txt` file line by line.
2. **Parse Card Information:**  Each line is parsed to extract the card identifier (first 19 digits) and the counter/reference value (last 2 digits).
3. **Data Structuring:** The extracted information is structured into a format suitable for further processing or display. 

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Access to File System:** The API requires read access to the file system where `cardxref.txt` is located.
2. **File Integrity:** The `cardxref.txt` file must adhere to the defined structure (19-digit card identifier followed by a 2-digit counter/reference).

## Validations and Rules

* **File Existence:** Validate that the `cardxref.txt` file exists before attempting to read.
* **File Format:** Ensure each line in the file adheres to the expected format. 
* **Data Type Validation:** Validate that extracted card identifiers and counter/reference values are numerical.

## Technical Details

**Main Classes:**

* **`CardIndexReader`:**  Handles reading and parsing of the `cardxref.txt` file.

**Main Functions/Methods:**

* **`getCardData()`:** Reads the `cardxref.txt` file and returns a structured representation of the data.
* **`parseCardLine(String line)`:** Parses a single line from the file to extract card identifier and counter/reference. 

**Variables:**

* **`cardIdentifier`:**  A 19-digit string representing the unique identifier of a credit card.
* **`counterReference`:** A 2-digit string representing either the usage count, a reference to another file, or card status.

## Security

* **Access Control:** Implement strict access control measures to limit who can read and potentially modify the `cardxref.txt` file.
* **Data Encryption:** Consider encrypting the `cardxref.txt` file to protect sensitive card information.

## Impact on Other Systems

* **Credit Card Management System:**  This API directly serves the Credit Card Management System, providing crucial card indexing functionality.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| CardIdentifier | String (19) | Unique 19-digit identifier for a credit card. |
| CounterReference | String (2)  |  2-digit code potentially representing usage count, file reference, or card status. |

## Main References

* **`cardxref.txt`:**  The file containing the credit card index data. 
 
**Additional Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage file read errors, format inconsistencies, and other potential issues.
* **Logging:**  Maintain logs of API usage and any errors encountered for debugging and auditing purposes.
* **Performance Optimization:** If dealing with a large `cardxref.txt` file, consider performance optimizations for reading and parsing the data efficiently.
