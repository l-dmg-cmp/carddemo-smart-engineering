# **CardDemo Field Validation**

## Title

- Title Document: CardDemo Field Validation Specification

## File

- `\CardDemo Application\Copybooks\CSSETATY.cpy`

## Summary Description

This document outlines the functionality of a code snippet within the CardDemo application, focusing on how the system provides visual feedback to users during data entry. The code ensures data accuracy by highlighting potential errors and guiding users to complete mandatory fields.

## Version History

- CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68: Initial implementation of the field validation logic.

## Process Description

The code snippet defines a process for validating user input in the CardDemo application. It performs the following steps:

1. **Error Check:** The system checks if the entered data, represented by `(TESTVAR1)`, is valid or if a required field is empty.
2. **Visual Feedback:** If an error is detected (e.g., invalid input), the corresponding field on the screen, denoted by `(SCRNVAR2)`, is highlighted in red. If a required field is left blank, an asterisk (*) is displayed within the field.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **User Input:**  The user must interact with the CardDemo application and enter data into the designated fields.
2. **Validation Rules:** Predefined rules determine the criteria for valid data (e.g., data type, format, range).
3. **Screen Display:** The CardDemo application must have an active screen displaying the relevant data fields.

## Validations and Rules

* **Data Validation:**  The system validates user input against predefined rules.
* **Mandatory Fields:** Specific fields are designated as mandatory and must be filled in by the user.

## Technical Details

**Variables:**

* **`(TESTVAR1)`:** This variable represents the user input that needs to be validated.
* **`(SCRNVAR2)`:** This variable represents the field on the screen that corresponds to the input data.
* **`CDEMO-PGM-REENTER`:**  This flag likely indicates if the user is re-entering data, potentially after correcting an error.

**Methods:**

* **`MOVE DFHRED TO (SCRNVAR2)C OF (MAPNAME3)O`:**  This line of code sets the color of the field `(SCRNVAR2)` to red, indicating an error.
* **`MOVE '*' TO (SCRNVAR2)O OF (MAPNAME3)O`:** This line of code places an asterisk (*) in the field `(SCRNVAR2)` to indicate a blank mandatory field.

## Impact on Other Systems

* **User Interface:** The code directly impacts the user interface by providing visual cues to guide user input and prevent errors.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `(TESTVAR1)` | Variable (Data Type Depends on Specific Field) | Holds the user input being validated. |
| `(SCRNVAR2)` | Screen Field | The visual representation of the data field on the application screen. |

## Main References

* **`DFHRED`:** A system constant or variable likely representing the color red, used for highlighting error fields.
* **`(MAPNAME3)O`:** This likely refers to a screen map or layout definition within the CardDemo application, specifying the organization and appearance of fields on the screen.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Accessibility:** Ensure the visual cues (red highlight and asterisk) are accessible to users with visual impairments. Consider alternative feedback mechanisms, such as screen reader announcements or alternative color schemes.
* **User Experience:**  Provide clear and concise error messages to help users understand and correct invalid input.
* **Error Logging:**  Consider logging validation errors for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.
