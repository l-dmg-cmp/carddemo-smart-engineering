# CardDemo Application - Inter-Program Communication Area Specification

## Title Document: CardDemo Application - Communication Area (COCOM01Y) Specification

## Summary Description

This document outlines the structure and function of the `CARDDEMO-COMMAREA`, a standardized data structure used for communication between different programs within the CardDemo application. This communication area ensures seamless data exchange and maintains data integrity throughout the credit card management system.

## Version History

- CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68: Initial version (July 19, 2022)

## Process Description

The `CARDDEMO-COMMAREA` acts as a container for information that needs to be passed between different programs within the CardDemo application. When one program needs to send data to another, it populates this communication area with the relevant information. The receiving program then extracts and utilizes this data. This process ensures consistency and clarity in data exchange.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Calling Program:** The program initiating the data transfer needs to populate the `CARDDEMO-COMMAREA` with the relevant information.
2. **Called Program:** The program receiving the data needs to be able to interpret and process the information stored in the `CARDDEMO-COMMAREA`.

## Validations and Rules

- **Data Type Validation:** Each field in the `CARDDEMO-COMMAREA` has a defined data type (e.g., PIC X for alphanumeric, PIC 9 for numeric). Programs populating the communication area must ensure that the data types are respected.
- **Field Length Validation:** Each field has a specified length. Programs should ensure that data entered into these fields does not exceed the defined length.

## Technical Details

**Data Structure:**

- **`CARDDEMO-COMMAREA`:** The main data structure containing all other information.

  - **`CDEMO-GENERAL-INFO`:**  Contains general information about the transaction or operation.

    - **`CDEMO-FROM-TRANID`:** Transaction ID of the sending program.
    - **`CDEMO-FROM-PROGRAM`:** Program name of the sender.
    - **`CDEMO-TO-TRANID`:** Transaction ID of the receiving program.
    - **`CDEMO-TO-PROGRAM`:** Program name of the receiver.
    - **`CDEMO-USER-ID`:** User ID initiating the transaction.
    - **`CDEMO-USER-TYPE`:** Type of user (Admin or Regular).
    - **`CDEMO-PGM-CONTEXT`:** Indicates whether the program is being entered for the first time or re-entered.

  - **`CDEMO-CUSTOMER-INFO`:** Contains customer-specific information.

    - **`CDEMO-CUST-ID`:** Unique customer identifier.
    - **`CDEMO-CUST-FNAME`:** Customer's first name.
    - **`CDEMO-CUST-MNAME`:** Customer's middle name.
    - **`CDEMO-CUST-LNAME`:** Customer's last name.

  - **`CDEMO-ACCOUNT-INFO`:** Contains account-related information.

    - **`CDEMO-ACCT-ID`:** Unique account identifier.
    - **`CDEMO-ACCT-STATUS`:** Current status of the account.

  - **`CDEMO-CARD-INFO`:** Contains credit card information.

    - **`CDEMO-CARD-NUM`:** Credit card number associated with the account.

  - **`CDEMO-MORE-INFO`:** Additional information for program flow control.

    - **`CDEMO-LAST-MAP`:**  Last map name used.
    - **`CDEMO-LAST-MAPSET`:** Last mapset used.

## Security

While not explicitly defined within this code snippet, the following security considerations are important:

- **Data Validation:**  Stringent data validation is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection or buffer overflow attacks.
- **Access Control:** Access to sensitive information within the `CARDDEMO-COMMAREA` (like credit card numbers) should be restricted based on user roles and permissions.
- **Data Encryption:** Consider encrypting sensitive data within the communication area to add an extra layer of security.

## Impact on Other Systems

- **All Programs within CardDemo:** This communication area is fundamental to the CardDemo application. Any changes to its structure or data definitions would require updates to all programs interacting with it.
