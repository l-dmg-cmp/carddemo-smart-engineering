# Transaction Type Code Translator

## Title

- Title Document: Transaction Type Code Translator - Functionality Specification

## Summary description

This document outlines the functionality of a program designed to translate numerical transaction codes into user-friendly descriptions. This program aims to improve the clarity and transparency of transaction data for various users, including customers, analysts, and customer service representatives.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version

## Process Description

The Transaction Type Code Translator program will function as a simple lookup table. It will accept a numerical transaction code as input and return the corresponding descriptive text associated with that code. 

1. **Input:** The program receives a numerical transaction code.
2. **Lookup:**  The program searches a predefined table for the input code.
3. **Output:** The program returns the descriptive text associated with the code. If the code is not found, it will return an error message.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Transaction Code Input:** A method for the user or another system to provide the transaction code to the program.
2. **Transaction Code Table:** A predefined table containing the mapping between numerical transaction codes and their corresponding descriptions.

## Validations and Rules

* **Code Existence:** The program must validate if the input code exists in the predefined table. If not, it should return an appropriate error message.
* **Code Uniqueness:** Each numerical transaction code in the table must be unique to ensure accurate translation.

## Technical Details

**Main Functions/Methods:**

* **`translateTransactionCode(int transactionCode)`:** This function accepts the numerical transaction code as input and returns the corresponding description.

**Variables:**

* **`transactionCode`:** An integer representing the numerical code for a specific transaction type. 
* **`transactionDescription`:** A string containing the descriptive text associated with the transaction code.

## Impact on Other Systems

* **Reporting and Analysis:** The program can be integrated into reporting systems to provide clear transaction descriptions, improving data analysis and interpretation.
* **Customer Service:** The program can be used by customer service representatives to quickly understand transaction types and provide better support to customers.
* **Data Integration:** The program facilitates seamless data integration between systems using different transaction code formats.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Transaction Code | Integer | A unique numerical code representing a specific transaction type. |
| Transaction Description | String | A clear and concise description of the transaction type. |

## Main References

* **Transaction Code Table:** The central reference point containing the mapping between numerical transaction codes and their descriptions. 


## Additional Considerations:

* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to manage invalid input codes gracefully.
* **Maintainability:** Design the code and the transaction code table for easy updates and maintenance as new transaction types are added or modified.
* **Localization:**  Consider if the program needs to support multiple languages for the transaction descriptions.

**Note:** This specification is based on a limited understanding of the existing system. Further discussions and analysis are required to finalize the program's design and implementation.
