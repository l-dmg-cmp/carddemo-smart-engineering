# Card Data Structure Specification

## Title Document: CardDemo Application - Credit Card Data Structure Specification

## File

- `\CVACT02Y.cpy`

## Summary Description

This document outlines the structure of credit card information within the CardDemo application, a COBOL-based system.  This structure ensures consistent and organized storage of crucial card details.

## Version History

- CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68 (July 19, 2022): Initial version of the card data structure.

## Process Description

The code defines a standardized format, named "CARD-RECORD," to represent the information associated with a credit card.  This format acts like a digital template with labeled compartments for each data point.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **COBOL Compiler:**  The system requires a COBOL compiler to interpret and process the data structure definition.
2. **VSAM Environment:** The application relies on a VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method) environment to store and manage the credit card data.

## Validations and Rules

* **Data Integrity:**  The structure enforces uniformity in how credit card information is stored, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
* **Security:** The inclusion of the CVV code field underscores the importance of protecting sensitive card data, although further security measures are likely implemented elsewhere in the system.
* **Account Linking:** The 'CARD-ACCT-ID' field links a card to a specific account, enabling transaction tracking and account management functions.
* **Card Lifecycle Management:** Fields like expiration date and active status allow the system to manage card validity and usage over time.

## Technical Details

**Variables:**

* **`CARD-RECORD`:** The overarching structure representing a credit card's information.

    * **`CARD-NUM`:** Stores the actual 16-digit credit card number.
    * **`CARD-ACCT-ID`:** Holds an 11-digit unique identifier that links the card to a specific account.
    * **`CARD-CVV-CD`:** Contains the 3-digit Card Verification Value (CVV), a security code usually found on the back of the card.
    * **`CARD-EMBOSSED-NAME`:** Stores the cardholder's name as it is physically embossed on the card (up to 50 characters).
    * **`CARD-EXPIRAION-DATE`:** Holds the date (10 characters) when the card is no longer valid.
    * **`CARD-ACTIVE-STATUS`:** Indicates whether the card is currently active and usable (1 character).
    * **`FILLER`:**  A placeholder to ensure consistent record length (59 characters).

## Security

* **Data Protection:** While this code defines the structure for holding sensitive information, it does not detail the specific security measures employed to protect this data.  Additional security implementations, such as encryption or access controls, are assumed to be in place within the broader system.

## Impact on Other Systems

* **Account Management:** This structure directly impacts how the system manages accounts, as each card is linked to an account ID.
* **Transaction Processing:** The card information is essential for processing transactions, verifying card details, and authorizing payments.
* **Reporting and Analytics:** The stored card data can be used for generating reports on card usage, account activity, and other analytical purposes.

## Models 

| Name Field          | Type | Description                                                                |
|---------------------|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CARD-NUM            | Text | The 16-digit credit card number.                                         |
| CARD-ACCT-ID        | Number | An 11-digit unique identifier linking the card to a specific account.    |
| CARD-CVV-CD         | Number | The 3-digit Card Verification Value, a security code on the card.        |
| CARD-EMBOSSED-NAME  | Text | The cardholder's name as embossed on the card (up to 50 characters).    |
| CARD-EXPIRAION-DATE | Date | The date when the credit card expires.                                     |
| CARD-ACTIVE-STATUS  | Text | A code indicating whether the card is currently active and usable.       |

## Main References

* **VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method):** The underlying data storage technology used to manage the credit card information.
* **COBOL Programming Language:**  The programming language used to define and manipulate the data structure.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Security Implementation:**  While not explicitly defined in this code snippet, robust security measures, such as encryption and access control, are crucial for safeguarding sensitive credit card data. 
* **Compliance:** The system should adhere to relevant industry standards and regulations for handling and storing credit card information (e.g., PCI DSS). 
* **Error Handling:**  Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage situations like invalid card numbers or expired cards.
