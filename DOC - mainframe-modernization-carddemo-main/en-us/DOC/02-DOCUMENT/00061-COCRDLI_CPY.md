# Credit Card Data Layout Specification

## Title Document: Credit Card Data Layout Specification for Internal and External Systems

## File

- File Route: \COCRDLI.CPY

## Summary Description

This document outlines the structure of credit card information (CCRDL) used within our system. It defines two layouts - CCRDLIAI (internal) and CCRDLIAO (external) - to handle data consistently and securely across different parts of the system and during communication with external entities.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial specification for credit card data layout.

## Process Description

This specification defines a standardized format for credit card information, ensuring consistency and interoperability within our systems and with external systems. The CCRDLIAI layout defines the internal structure of credit card information, while the CCRDLIAO layout is used for exchanging information with external systems or displaying it to users.

## Requirements

1.  **Standardized Data Format:** A consistent format for credit card data is crucial for seamless processing and communication.
2.  **Security:** Sensitive credit card information requires secure handling and storage.

## Validations and Rules

1.  **Data Type Validation:** Each field in the layout must adhere to the defined data type (e.g., numeric, alphanumeric).
2.  **Field Length Validation:** The length of each field should be limited to the specified number of characters.
3.  **Data Consistency:** Ensure data consistency between internal and external layouts through appropriate mapping and transformation rules.
4.  **Security Compliance:** Adhere to industry standards (e.g., PCI DSS) for handling and storing sensitive cardholder data.
