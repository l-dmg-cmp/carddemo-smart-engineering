# CardDemo Transaction Category Management

## Title Document: CardDemo Transaction Category Management - Data Structure Specification

## File

- `\CVTRA04Y.cpy`

## Summary Description

This document outlines the data structure used in the CardDemo application to categorize credit card transactions. It ensures that all transactions are classified consistently for reporting and analysis.

## Version History

- `CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68`: Initial version - July 19, 2022

## Process Description

The CardDemo application uses a standardized structure to classify and store information about different transaction categories. This structure ensures each transaction is categorized based on its type and a more specific sub-category, making it easier to track and analyze different transaction types. 

## Requirements to Start the Process

1.  **Transaction Data:** The system needs to receive information about each transaction, including its type.

## Validations and Rules

*   **Unique Category Codes:** Each transaction category must have a unique combination of Type Code and Category Code to avoid misclassification.
*   **Clear and Concise Descriptions:** The category description should be easy to understand for reporting and user interface purposes.

## Technical Details

**Variables:**

*   **`TRAN-CAT-RECORD`:**  Represents a single transaction category record.

    *   **`TRAN-CAT-KEY`:** Uniquely identifies each transaction category.

        *   **`TRAN-TYPE-CD`:**  (2 characters) A two-character code representing the general type of transaction (e.g., 'PR' for Purchase, 'PA' for Payment).
        *   **`TRAN-CAT-CD`:** (4 digits) A four-digit code that further categorizes the transaction within its type (e.g., '0001' for Online Purchase, '0002' for In-store Purchase under the 'PR' type).

    *   **`TRAN-CAT-TYPE-DESC`:** (50 characters) A short description of the transaction category.

## Impact on Other Systems

*   **Reporting Module:** The consistent categorization of transactions directly impacts the accuracy and granularity of reports generated by the system.
*   **Data Analysis:**  The structured data enables easier analysis of transaction trends and patterns.

## Models

| Name Field            | Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| :-------------------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TRAN-TYPE-CD`       | String (2)  | Two-character code representing the general type of transaction (e.g., 'PR' for Purchase, 'PA' for Payment).                                                                  |
| `TRAN-CAT-CD`        | String (4)  | Four-digit code that provides a specific sub-category within the transaction type (e.g., '0001' for Online Purchase, '0002' for In-store Purchase under the 'PR' type). |
| `TRAN-CAT-TYPE-DESC` | String (50) | A short, human-readable description of the transaction category.                                                                                                             |
