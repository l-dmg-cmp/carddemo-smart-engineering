# **CardDemo Application - Date Validation Module**

## Title

- Title Document: CardDemo Application - Date Validation Module Specification

## File

- File Route: `\src\CSUTLDPY.cpy`

## Summary Description

This document outlines the specifications for a COBOL subroutine designed to validate dates within the CardDemo application.  The module functions as a critical component ensuring data integrity by preventing the entry and processing of invalid or illogical dates.  This directly supports core business operations related to credit card management.

## Version History

- CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68: Initial implementation of the date validation module.

## Process Description

The Date Validation Module performs rigorous checks on dates provided as input, primarily focusing on date of birth entries.  The process involves:

1. **Format Check:**  Verification that the date adheres to the required format (YYYYMMDD).
2. **Component Validation:**  Individual assessment of year, month, and day components:
    * **Year:**  Confirms a reasonable century (19xx or 20xx) for practicality.
    * **Month:**  Ensures the month falls within the valid range (1-12).
    * **Day:**  Verifies the day is valid within the context of the given month, accounting for month lengths.
3. **Leap Year Logic:**  Special handling for February, accepting February 29th only in leap years.
4. **Future Date Prevention:**  Comparison against the current date to disallow future dates of birth.
5. **External Verification (Optional):**  Provision for utilizing an external service (`CSUTLDTC`) for potentially more comprehensive date validation, though details of this service are outside the scope of this module.

## Requirements to Start the Process

* **Input Date:**  A date string provided in 'CCYYMMDD' format.
* **Current Date:**  Access to the system's current date.

## Validations and Rules

* **Data Integrity:**  The primary driving force behind this module is to ensure all dates within the system are accurate.  This is crucial for calculations, eligibility checks, and reporting.
* **User Experience:**  While transparent to the user, the module prevents issues stemming from simple date errors, leading to a smoother application experience.
* **Compliance:**  This module aids in adhering to likely financial regulations regarding data accuracy, a critical aspect of credit card management.

## Technical Details

**Main Paragraphs (Functions):**

*  **`EDIT-DATE-CCYYMMDD`:**  The primary entry point for date validation.  It orchestrates the validation steps and sets flags based on the outcome.
*  **`EDIT-YEAR-CCYY`:**  Focuses on validating the year component, checking for format, numeric values, and a reasonable century.
*  **`EDIT-MONTH`:**  Validates the month component, ensuring it's within the acceptable range.
*  **`EDIT-DAY`:**  Validates the day component, taking into account the month and leap years.
*  **`EDIT-DAY-MONTH-YEAR`:**  Performs combined checks on day, month, and year to catch any invalid combinations.
*  **`EDIT-DATE-LE`:**  Provides an optional layer of validation using external Language Environment (LE) services.
*  **`EDIT-DATE-OF-BIRTH`:**  Specifically checks if the provided date is in the future, preventing invalid date of birth entries.

**Variables:**

*  `WS-EDIT-DATE-CCYYMMDD`:  The input date string in 'CCYYMMDD' format.
*  `WS-EDIT-DATE-IS-VALID`:  A flag indicating whether the date passed all validation checks.
*  `WS-EDIT-VARIABLE-NAME`:  Likely holds the name of the variable being validated, used for error messages.
*  `WS-RETURN-MSG`:  A string containing an error message if validation fails.
*  `WS-CURRENT-DATE-YYYYMMDD`:  The system's current date.

## Security

While not explicitly detailed in the provided code, any system handling sensitive data like dates of birth should have robust security measures in place.  This includes:

*  **Access Control:**  Limiting access to the date validation module and its underlying data to authorized personnel only.
*  **Input Sanitization:**  Protecting against vulnerabilities like SQL injection by sanitizing all inputs to the module.

## Impact on Other Systems

*  **Account Management:**  Accurate dates are crucial for account creation, age verification, and other related processes.
*  **Transaction Processing:**  Date accuracy impacts transaction authorization, interest calculations, and statement generation.
*  **Reporting:**  Reliable dates are essential for generating accurate reports for regulatory compliance and business analysis.

## Models

N/A - This module focuses on data validation and doesn't directly define data models.

## Main References

*  `CSUTLDTC`:  An external service (potentially a utility program) for additional date validation.  Further investigation is needed to understand its specifics.
*  COBOL Intrinsic Functions:  The module relies heavily on built-in COBOL functions for date manipulation, string handling, and numeric operations.  

**Additional Considerations:**

*  **Error Handling:**  While the module sets flags and potentially populates error messages, a comprehensive error handling strategy should be implemented to gracefully handle validation failures and inform users appropriately.
*  **Internationalization:**  Consider if the CardDemo application will be used in regions with different date formats.  If so, the module should be adaptable to handle various formats.
*  **Performance:**  Given the frequent use of date validations, ensure the module's code is optimized for performance to avoid impacting the overall application responsiveness.
