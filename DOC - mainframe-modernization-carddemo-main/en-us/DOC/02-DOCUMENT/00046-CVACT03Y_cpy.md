## Summary Description

This document outlines the structure and function of the Card Cross-Reference Record within the Credit Card Management System. This record acts as a link between a credit card, its owner (the customer), and their associated account. 

## Version History

- CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68: Initial version (July 19, 2022)

## Process Description

The Card Cross-Reference Record stores the essential information needed to connect a credit card to a specific customer and their account. This process ensures:

1. **Card Identification:** Each credit card is uniquely identified by its number.
2. **Customer Association:**  The system can readily determine the customer who owns a particular credit card.
3. **Account Linking:**  The specific account associated with a credit card is clearly defined.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Credit Card Number:** A valid 16-digit credit card number.
2. **Customer ID:** A unique identifier for the customer.
3. **Account ID:**  A unique identifier for the account.

## Validations and Rules

* **Unique Card Number:** Each credit card number must be unique within the system, ensuring that only one customer and account are linked to it.
* **Valid Customer ID:** The Customer ID must exist within the customer database, guaranteeing that the card is linked to a valid customer.
* **Valid Account ID:** The Account ID must exist within the account database, ensuring the card is associated with an active account.

## Technical Details

**Variables:**

* **`XREF-CARD-NUM`:** Stores the 16-digit credit card number (text format).
* **`XREF-CUST-ID`:** Stores the unique 9-digit identifier for the customer (numerical format).
* **`XREF-ACCT-ID`:** Stores the unique 11-digit identifier for the account (numerical format).
* **`FILLER`:**  Unused space reserved for future use or system compatibility (text format).

## Impact on Other Systems

* **Transaction Processing:**  This record is crucial for attributing transactions to the correct customer and account.
* **Customer Management:**  Provides a direct link from customer data to their credit card information.
* **Account Management:** Enables access to credit card details directly from an account.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| XREF-CARD-NUM | Text (X(16)) | The 16-digit credit card number. |
| XREF-CUST-ID | Number (9(09)) | The 9-digit unique identifier for the customer. |
| XREF-ACCT-ID | Number (9(11)) | The 11-digit unique identifier for the account. |
| FILLER | Text (X(14)) | Unused space. |

## Main References

* **Customer Database:** The system where customer information is stored and managed.
* **Account Database:** The system where account information is stored and managed.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Data Security:** Implement robust security measures to protect this sensitive data, including encryption and access control.
* **Data Integrity:** Ensure data consistency through validation rules and database constraints.
* **Performance Optimization:** Design the data structure and access methods for optimal performance, particularly for high-volume transactions.
