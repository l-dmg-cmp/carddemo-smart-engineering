# CardDemo Credit Card Transaction Detail Report Generation

## Title

- Title Document: CardDemo Credit Card Transaction Detail Report Generation - Program Specification

## File

- File: \src\CBTRN03C.cbl

## Summary Description

This document outlines the specifications for the CBTRN03C program within the CardDemo application. This batch COBOL program generates a detailed report of credit card transactions, summarizing key information for a specific period. 

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version - CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68 (July 19, 2022)

## Process Description

The CBTRN03C program reads credit card transaction data from a sequential file (TRANSACT-FILE), retrieves related information from indexed files (XREF-FILE, TRANTYPE-FILE, TRANCATG-FILE), and generates a formatted report (REPORT-FILE) summarizing the transactions. 

Here's a simplified breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization:** The program opens all necessary files (transaction data, cross-reference data for accounts, transaction types, transaction categories, report output, and date parameters).
2. **Date Range Input:** It reads the start and end dates for the report from a separate file (DATE-PARMS-FILE).
3. **Transaction Processing:** The program reads each transaction record and performs the following:
   - **Data Retrieval:** Fetches additional information about the transaction, such as account details, transaction type description, and category description from the respective indexed files.
   - **Data Aggregation:** Calculates page totals, account totals, and a grand total for the transactions processed.
   - **Report Formatting:**  Formats the retrieved information into a structured report, including headers, transaction details, and summary totals.
4. **Report Generation:** The program writes the formatted report to an output file (REPORT-FILE).
5. **Termination:** The program closes all opened files and ends.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Input Files:**
   - **TRANSACT-FILE:** Contains credit card transaction records.
   - **XREF-FILE:**  Contains cross-reference data linking card numbers to account IDs.
   - **TRANTYPE-FILE:** Contains descriptions for different transaction types.
   - **TRANCATG-FILE:** Contains descriptions for different transaction categories.
   - **DATE-PARMS-FILE:** Contains the start and end dates for the report period. 

2. **Output File:**
   - **REPORT-FILE:** The program will generate a report file containing the detailed transaction information.

## Validations and Rules

- **Date Range Validation:** The program should validate the start and end dates read from the DATE-PARMS-FILE to ensure they are valid dates and that the start date is not after the end date.
- **File Status Checks:**  The program performs checks on the status of file operations (open, read, write, close) and handles any errors encountered.
- **Data Validation:** While not explicitly described, the program should ideally include data validation checks on the transaction data to ensure its accuracy and consistency. For example:
    - Validating transaction amounts to be numeric.
    - Verifying transaction types and categories against the data in the respective files.
    - Checking for any invalid or missing data elements in the transaction records.

## Security

- **Not Applicable:** The provided code snippet does not contain any explicit security implementations. 

**Security Considerations:**

- **Access Control:**  Implement access control mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access to the program, input files, and output reports. This could involve user authentication and authorization based on predefined roles and permissions.
- **Data Encryption:**  Consider encrypting sensitive data within the transaction files, especially if they contain personally identifiable information (PII) or financial details, to protect against unauthorized access.
- **Audit Logging:** Implement audit logging to track program execution, user access, and any modifications made to the data. This helps in identifying and investigating any security breaches or suspicious activities.

## Impact on Other Systems

- **Data Dependencies:** The program depends on the timely and accurate availability of data from the input files (transaction data, cross-reference data, transaction types, transaction categories, and date parameters). Any issues or delays in these source systems will directly impact the report generation process.
- **Downstream Systems:** The generated transaction detail report may be used as input for other downstream systems, such as:
    - **Reconciliation Systems:**  For reconciling transactions with bank statements and other financial records.
    - **Fraud Detection Systems:** For identifying potentially fraudulent transactions based on patterns and anomalies in the data.
    - **Business Intelligence Systems:** For analyzing transaction trends, customer behavior, and other business insights.
