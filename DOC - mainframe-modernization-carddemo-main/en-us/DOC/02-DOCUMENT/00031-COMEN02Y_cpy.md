# CardDemo Application: Admin Menu

## Title

- Title Document: CardDemo Application - Admin Menu Specification

## Summary description

This document outlines the functionality of the CardDemo Application's Admin Menu, specifically focusing on the options available to administrative users. This menu serves as a central hub for administrators to manage various aspects of the credit card system.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version (CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68, 2022-07-19 23:15:58 CDT)

## Process Description

The Admin Menu within the CardDemo Application provides a list of functionalities accessible by administrative users. Upon logging in, administrators are presented with this menu, allowing them to choose from various options. Each option corresponds to a specific program or module within the system, granting access to functionalities like:

1. **Account Management:** Viewing and updating account information for cardholders.
2. **Credit Card Management:** Listing, viewing, adding, and updating credit card details.
3. **Transaction Management:** Viewing, adding, and generating reports on card transactions.
4. **Bill Payment Processing:** Managing bill payment functionalities.
5. **Reporting:** Accessing various reports related to credit card operations.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Administrator Authentication:** Only authenticated administrative users should have access to the Admin Menu.
2. **Menu Display:** The application should correctly display the Admin Menu options upon successful administrator login.

## Validations and Rules

* **User Role Validation:** The system must verify the user's role to ensure only authorized administrators can access and interact with the Admin Menu options.

## Technical Details

**Main Data Structure:**

* **`CARDDEMO-MAIN-MENU-OPTIONS`:**  A COBOL data structure containing the menu options.

**Fields:**

* **`CDEMO-MENU-OPT-NUM`:**  A two-digit number representing the sequence of the menu option.
* **`CDEMO-MENU-OPT-NAME`:** A 35-character field displaying the name of the menu option as seen by the administrator.
* **`CDEMO-MENU-OPT-PGMNAME`:** An eight-character field storing the program name associated with each menu option. This program is executed when the administrator selects the corresponding menu item.
* **`CDEMO-MENU-OPT-USRTYPE`:**  A one-character field indicating the user type authorized to access this menu option. In this case, it's always 'U' for 'User', implying administrative users are considered a type of user within the system.

## Security

* **Access Control:** Access to the Admin Menu and its functionalities is restricted to authenticated administrator accounts. 
* **Authorization:** The application should have a mechanism to verify the user's role and permissions before granting access to any specific functionality within the Admin Menu.

## Impact on Other Systems

* **User Management System:** The Admin Menu likely interacts with the system's user management module for authentication and authorization purposes.
* **Other CardDemo Modules:**  Each menu option triggers a corresponding program or module within the CardDemo Application.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CDEMO-MENU-OPT-NUM` | Numeric (9(02)) | Menu option sequence number. |
| `CDEMO-MENU-OPT-NAME` | Alphanumeric (X(35)) | Display name of the menu option. |
| `CDEMO-MENU-OPT-PGMNAME` | Alphanumeric (X(08)) | Program name associated with the menu option. |
| `CDEMO-MENU-OPT-USRTYPE` | Alphanumeric (X(01)) | User type authorized to access the option (always 'U' in this case). |

## Main References

* **COBOL Program Structure:** The menu options are defined within a COBOL program, suggesting a mainframe environment.
* **CardDemo Application Modules:** The menu options directly reference other programs or modules within the CardDemo Application, indicating a modular system design.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **User Interface:**  The document assumes the Admin Menu is displayed through a text-based interface, typical of mainframe applications. However, if the CardDemo application has a graphical user interface (GUI), the menu's visual design and interaction should be detailed.
* **Menu Hierarchy:** The provided code snippet represents a single level menu. If the actual Admin Menu has sub-menus or a hierarchical structure, this should be documented for clarity. 
* **Error Handling:** Specify how the system should handle invalid menu selections or any errors encountered while executing the selected program.
