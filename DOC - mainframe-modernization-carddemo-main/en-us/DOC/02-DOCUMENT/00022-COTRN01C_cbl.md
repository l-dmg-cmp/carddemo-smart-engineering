# CardDemo Transaction Details Retrieval

## Title Document: CardDemo Transaction Details Retrieval - Program Specification

## File

- `\src\COTRN01C.cbl`

## Summary Description

This document outlines the specifications for the "COTRN01C" program within the CardDemo application. This program is designed for call center representatives to quickly access and view details of specific credit card transactions, aiding in customer service and transaction verification.

## Version History

- CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68 (July 19, 2022): Initial version

## Process Description

The "COTRN01C" program facilitates the retrieval and display of individual transaction details within the CardDemo application. The process follows these steps:

1. **Transaction ID Input:** The call center representative enters a unique Transaction ID into the system.
2. **Data Retrieval:** The program searches the 'TRANSACT' database for a record matching the provided Transaction ID.
3. **Transaction Details Display:** If a match is found, the program presents all relevant transaction details on the representative's screen. This includes information such as transaction amount, date, card number, merchant details, and more.
4. **Error Handling:** In cases where the entered Transaction ID is blank or doesn't match any records in the database, an error message is displayed, prompting the representative to enter a valid ID.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Access to CardDemo Application:** The call center representative needs to be logged into the CardDemo application.
2. **Transaction ID:** A valid Transaction ID is required to retrieve specific transaction details.

## Validations and Rules

- **Unique Transaction ID:** Each transaction within the CardDemo system is assigned a unique ID to ensure accurate retrieval and prevent ambiguity.
- **Data Access Control:**  The program is designed to only retrieve and display information from the 'TRANSACT' database for the specific Transaction ID provided, ensuring data security.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Transaction details are presented in an easy-to-understand format on the representative's screen, facilitating efficient customer service.

## Technical Details

**Main Program:**

- **COTRN01C:** This program handles the entire process of receiving the Transaction ID, retrieving data, and displaying the information.

**Functions/Methods:**

- **PROCESS-ENTER-KEY:**  This function processes the entered Transaction ID, validating it and initiating the data retrieval process.
- **READ-TRANSACT-FILE:** This function reads the 'TRANSACT' database to find and retrieve the transaction record matching the provided ID.
- **SEND-TRNVIEW-SCREEN:** This function displays the retrieved transaction details or error messages to the representative.
- **RETURN-TO-PREV-SCREEN:** This function allows the representative to return to the previous screen.
- **CLEAR-CURRENT-SCREEN:**  This function clears the current screen, preparing it for new input or information.
- **INITIALIZE-ALL-FIELDS:** This function initializes all data fields, ensuring data integrity.
- **POPULATE-HEADER-INFO:** This function populates the header information of the screen with relevant details.

**Variables:**

- **WS-TRANID:** Stores the transaction code 'CT01'.
- **WS-TRANSACT-FILE:**  Stores the name of the database file 'TRANSACT'.
- **TRAN-ID:**  Stores the entered Transaction ID.
- **WS-MESSAGE:** Stores messages to be displayed to the user, including error messages.
- **WS-RESP-CD:** Stores the response code from database operations.
- **WS-REAS-CD:**  Stores the reason code from database operations.
- **ERRMSGO:**  Displays error messages to the user.
- **TRNIDINI:**  Receives the entered Transaction ID from the input field.
- **TRNIDI, CARDNUMI, TTYPCDI, TCATCDI, TRNSRCI, TRNAMTI, TDESCI, TORIGDTI, TPROCDTI, MIDI, MNAMEI, MCITYI, MZIPI:** These variables store the details of the retrieved transaction, such as Transaction ID, card number, transaction type, amount, description, timestamps, and merchant details.

## Security

- **Secure Data Retrieval:** The program interacts with the 'TRANSACT' database using controlled procedures, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access the data.
- **Data Display Restrictions:** The program only displays information related to the specific Transaction ID entered, limiting data exposure.

## Impact on Other Systems

- **TRANSACT Database:** The program directly interacts with the 'TRANSACT' database to retrieve transaction details.
