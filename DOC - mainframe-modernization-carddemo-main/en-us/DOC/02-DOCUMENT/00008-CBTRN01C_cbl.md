# CardDemo Daily Transaction Processing Specification

## Title

- Title Document: CardDemo - Daily Transaction Processing - Program Specification

## File

- File: `\src\CBTRN01C.cbl`

## Summary Description

This document outlines the specifications for the CardDemo Daily Transaction Processing program (CBTRN01C). This batch program is vital for processing daily credit card transactions. It reads transaction data, verifies card validity, links transactions to customer accounts, and prepares for transaction record updates. Think of it as an automated system that ensures all transactions are checked against our records and correctly reflected in customer accounts.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version

## Process Description

The Daily Transaction Processing program performs the following steps:

1. **File Preparation:** It opens all necessary files containing daily transactions, customer details, card and account information, and transaction records.
2. **Transaction Processing:** It reads each transaction from the daily transaction file and performs the following:
    - **Card Verification:** Checks if the card used in the transaction is valid.
    - **Account Retrieval:** If the card is valid, it retrieves the associated account information.
    - **Preparation for Update:** Prepares the data to update transaction records.
3. **File Closure:** After processing all transactions, it closes all opened files.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Daily Transaction File (DALYTRAN):**  This file contains the daily credit card transactions that need to be processed.
2. **Customer File (CUSTFILE):** Contains information about each customer.
3. **Card-Account Cross-Reference File (XREFFILE):** Links card numbers to their corresponding account IDs.
4. **Card Information File (CARDFILE):** Holds details for each credit card.
5. **Account Information File (ACCTFILE):**  Contains information for each account.
6. **Transaction Records File (TRANFILE):**  Stores details of processed transactions.

## Validations and Rules

- **Card Verification:** The program verifies each card number against the Card-Account Cross-Reference file to ensure it's a valid and active card.
- **Account Linking:** Each valid card must be linked to a customer account to ensure transactions are correctly reflected in their account balance and history.
- **Transaction Logging:** All processed transactions are logged, creating an auditable history of all activities.

## Technical Details

**Main Program:**

- **`CBTRN01C`:** The main COBOL program responsible for daily transaction processing.

**Files:**

- **`DALYTRAN-FILE`:**  Input file containing daily transactions.
- **`CUSTOMER-FILE`:**  Indexed file containing customer information.
- **`XREF-FILE`:**  Indexed file linking card numbers to account IDs.
- **`CARD-FILE`:**  Indexed file containing card information.
- **`ACCOUNT-FILE`:**  Indexed file containing account information.
- **`TRANSACT-FILE`:**  Indexed file for storing transaction records.

**Variables:**

- **`DALYTRAN-CARD-NUM`:**  The card number from the daily transaction record.
- **`XREF-ACCT-ID`:**  The account ID associated with the card number, retrieved from the cross-reference file.
- **`XREF-CUST-ID`:**  The customer ID associated with the card number, retrieved from the cross-reference file.
- **`ACCT-ID`:** The account ID used to access account information.

**Methods:**

- **`1000-DALYTRAN-GET-NEXT`:** Reads the next transaction record from the daily transaction file.
- **`2000-LOOKUP-XREF`:** Looks up the card number in the cross-reference file to retrieve the associated account and customer IDs.
- **`3000-READ-ACCOUNT`:** Reads the account information from the account file using the retrieved account ID.

## Security

- While not explicitly detailed in the provided code, access to the program and the data files should be restricted to authorized personnel only.
- Sensitive information like card numbers and account details should be encrypted both in storage and during processing to prevent unauthorized access.

## Impact on Other Systems

- This program directly impacts the accuracy and completeness of data in the Customer File, Card Information File, Account Information File, and Transaction Records File.
- Any downstream systems or reports relying on this data will be affected by the accuracy and timeliness of this program's processing.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FD-TRAN-ID` | String | Unique identifier for each transaction. |
| `FD-CUST-ID` | String | Unique identifier for each customer. |
| `FD-XREF-CARD-NUM` | String | Credit card number, used as a key in the cross-reference file. |
| `FD-XREF-ACCT-ID` | String | Account ID associated with a specific card number. |
| `FD-XREF-CUST-ID` | String | Customer ID associated with a specific card number. |
| `FD-CARD-NUM` | String | Credit card number, used as a key in the card information file. |
| `FD-ACCT-ID` | String | Unique identifier for each account. |

## Main References

- **Customer File (CUSTFILE):** Provides customer details.
- **Card-Account Cross-Reference File (XREFFILE):** Links card numbers to account and customer IDs.
- **Card Information File (CARDFILE):**  Contains details about each credit card.
- **Account Information File (ACCTFILE):**  Holds details about each account.
- **Transaction Records File (TRANFILE):**  Stores the processed transaction records.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Error Handling:**  The program should have robust error handling to manage any issues encountered during file processing, data validation, or record retrieval. It should log these errors for review and resolution.
- **Performance:**  The program should be optimized for performance, especially considering it processes a large volume of daily transactions. This might involve using efficient data structures and algorithms.
- **Scalability:**  The program should be designed to handle increasing volumes of transactions in the future as the business grows.
