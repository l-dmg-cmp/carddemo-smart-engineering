# Credit Card Detail Update Program

## Title
- Title Document: Credit Card Detail Update Program Specification

## File
-  \src\COCRDUPC.cbl

## Summary Description

This document outlines the specifications for a program that manages updates to credit card information within a larger financial system. This program, referred to as the Credit Card Detail Update Program, is designed to ensure the secure and accurate modification of sensitive credit card data. 

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version

## Process Description

The Credit Card Detail Update Program serves as a critical component in maintaining the accuracy and integrity of credit card information. The program is initiated upon a user request to view or modify existing credit card details.

1. **Request Reception:** The program receives a request, which may originate from a user interacting with a terminal or another authorized system.

2. **Data Retrieval:** Upon receiving a request, the program retrieves the existing credit card information from a database, using the provided account and card numbers to locate the correct record.

3. **Input Validation:** Before any modifications are made, the program performs rigorous validation checks on the user's input. This ensures that only valid and consistent data is entered. Examples of validation rules include:
    - Account number must be numeric and 11 digits long
    - Cardholder's name can only contain letters and spaces
    - Expiry date must be a valid date in the future.

4. **Update Processing:** Once the input data passes all validation checks, the program proceeds to update the corresponding record in the database. To prevent data corruption from simultaneous updates, the program implements locking mechanisms, ensuring that only one update can occur on a specific record at a time.

5. **Confirmation and Feedback:**  After the update is processed, the program provides feedback to the user, confirming the success or failure of the operation. This feedback may include details about any errors encountered during the process.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **User Request:** A request to view or update credit card details is required to initiate the program. This could come from a user at a terminal, an administrator accessing the system, or another authorized program.

2. **Account and Card Numbers:** The program requires both the account number and credit card number as input to identify and retrieve the correct record from the database.

## Validations and Rules

* **Data Integrity:** The program prioritizes data accuracy. It achieves this through:
    - **Rigorous Input Validation:**  Multiple checks are implemented to ensure that the data entered by the user conforms to predefined formats and rules, preventing invalid or inconsistent data from being stored.
    - **Concurrency Control:** Locking mechanisms are used to prevent conflicts that could arise from multiple users attempting to modify the same record simultaneously. This is crucial for maintaining data consistency.

* **Security:** While not explicitly detailed in the provided code, it is crucial that the program incorporates robust security measures to protect sensitive credit card information. This should include:
    - **User Authentication and Authorization:** Verification of user credentials and access rights before granting permission to view or modify any credit card details.
    - **Data Encryption:**  Encrypting sensitive data both in transit and at rest to prevent unauthorized access.

* **Audit Trail:** The program should maintain a comprehensive audit trail of all update actions performed. This log should record:
    - User ID or name of the individual who made the changes.
    - Timestamp of each action.
    - Specific data fields that were modified.
    - Old and new values of the changed data.

## Technical Details

**Main Program:**
* **`COCRDUPC`:**  The primary COBOL program responsible for orchestrating the credit card detail update process.

**Variables:**
* **`CC-ACCT-ID`:** Stores the account number associated with the credit card being updated.
* **`CC-CARD-NUM`:** Stores the credit card number being updated.
* **`CCUP-OLD-DETAILS`:** Structure containing the original credit card details retrieved from the database.
* **`CCUP-NEW-DETAILS`:** Structure containing the new credit card details input by the user, after validation.
* **`CARD-UPDATE-RECORD`:** A structure containing the updated credit card information to be written back to the database.
* **`WS-RESP-CD`:**  Holds the response code from database operations, indicating success or failure.
* **`WS-REAS-CD`:** Holds a reason code providing more specific information about the outcome of database operations.

**Methods (Sections):**
* **`1000-PROCESS-INPUTS`:**  Handles receiving and validating the input data.
* **`2000-DECIDE-ACTION`:**  Determines the appropriate course of action based on user input and validation results.
* **`3000-SEND-MAP`:**  Manages the presentation of information and interaction with the user interface.
* **`9000-READ-DATA`:**  Retrieves credit card data from the database.
* **`9200-WRITE-PROCESSING`:**  Handles the process of updating the credit card record in the database.

## Security

* **Not Explicitly Defined:** The provided code snippet does not contain specific security implementations. It is **essential** to integrate robust security measures into this program to protect sensitive financial data.

## Impact on Other Systems

This program is likely to interact with:

* **Database System:** It directly reads from and writes to a database containing credit card information.
* **User Interface:** It receives input from and sends output to a user interface, which could be a terminal or a graphical interface.
* **Auditing System:** It may send log data to an auditing system for tracking and regulatory compliance.

## Models

| Field Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CARD-ACCT-ID` | Numeric(11) | Account number associated with the credit card. |
| `CARD-CARD-NUM` | Numeric(16) | Credit card number. |
| `CARD-CVV-CD` | Numeric(3) | Card Verification Value (CVV) code. |
| `CARD-NAME-EMBOSSED` | Alphanumeric(50) | Name of the cardholder as embossed on the card. |
| `CARD-EXPIRAION-DATE` | Alphanumeric(10) | Expiration date of the credit card (MM/YY). |
| `CARD-ACTIVE-STATUS` | Alphanumeric(1) | Status of the card (e.g., 'Y' for active, 'N' for inactive). |

## Main References

* **Database Tables:** The program relies on database tables or files containing credit card data. The specific names and structures of these tables are not provided in the code snippet.
* **User Interface Definitions:** The program interacts with a user interface, which might be defined using tools like BMS (Basic Mapping Support).

## Additional Considerations

* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected conditions, log errors appropriately, and provide informative error messages to the user.
* **Performance:**  Optimize the program for performance to ensure efficient data retrieval, validation, and update processes, especially considering the sensitive nature of the data and potential for high transaction volumes.
* **Maintainability:** Adhere to coding standards and best practices for COBOL to ensure the program is easily maintainable and understandable for future developers.

**Note:** This specification is based on the provided code snippet and might not include all aspects of a production-ready system. Further analysis and collaboration with business stakeholders and technical experts are necessary to develop a complete and detailed specification.
