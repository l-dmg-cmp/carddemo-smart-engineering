# Credit Card Transaction Processing System

## Title

- Title Document: Credit Card Transaction Processing System - Transaction Category Code Specification

## Summary Description

This document outlines the structure and function of the "trancatg.txt" file within the Credit Card Transaction Processing System. This file acts as a central repository for defining and managing various transaction category codes. These codes categorize every credit card transaction, such as purchases, cash advances, payments, and refunds.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version

## Process Description

The "trancatg.txt" file operates as a static reference table. Each line in the file represents a unique transaction category code and its corresponding description. 

1. **Transaction Code Identification:**  When a transaction occurs, the system identifies its type using the designated code.
2. **Code Lookup:** The system then refers to "trancatg.txt" to retrieve the matching description for the transaction code. 
3. **Transaction Categorization:** This process ensures accurate categorization of all credit card transactions within the system.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **"trancatg.txt" File:**  This file must be present and properly formatted for the system to function correctly.
2. **Transaction Data:** The system requires input data for each transaction, including the appropriate category code.

## Validations and Rules

* **Unique Codes:** Each transaction category code within "trancatg.txt" must be unique to avoid processing errors.
* **Code Format:**  Codes should adhere to a consistent format (e.g., six digits) to maintain data integrity.
* **Description Clarity:** Descriptions should be concise and clearly explain the transaction category.

## Technical Details

**File Structure:**

- **Transaction Code:**  A unique alphanumeric code identifying the transaction category (e.g., "010001").
- **Transaction Description:**  A brief explanation of the transaction category (e.g., "Regular Sales Draft").
- **Padding:**  Additional spaces for formatting purposes, not impacting functionality.

**Variables:**

* **TransactionCode:**  Stores the six-digit code read from the transaction data.

**Methods:**

* **LookupTransactionDescription(TransactionCode):** Searches "trancatg.txt" using the provided TransactionCode and returns the corresponding description.

## Security

- **Access Control:**  Implement access controls to restrict unauthorized modification of the "trancatg.txt" file.

## Impact on Other Systems

- **Reporting Systems:** Transaction category codes are crucial for generating accurate reports on credit card activity.
- **Accounting Systems:** These codes may be used for financial reconciliation and accounting purposes.
- **Fraud Detection:** Categorization helps identify unusual transaction patterns and potential fraud.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| TransactionCode | String | Unique six-digit code representing a transaction category. |
| TransactionDescription | String | Descriptive text explaining the transaction category. |

## Main References

* **"trancatg.txt" File:** The primary data source for transaction category codes and descriptions.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Code Management:**  Establish a process for adding, modifying, or retiring transaction category codes.
* **Data Integrity:** Implement checks to ensure the accuracy and consistency of data within "trancatg.txt."
* **Version Control:**  Maintain version history for "trancatg.txt" to track changes over time.

**Note:**  This specification provides a high-level understanding of the "trancatg.txt" file's role. Further technical specifications may be required for system implementation.
