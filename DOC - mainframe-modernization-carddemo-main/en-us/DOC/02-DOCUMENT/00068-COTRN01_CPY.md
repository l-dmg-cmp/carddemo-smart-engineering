# **Credit Card Transaction Record Specification**

## Title

- Title Document: Credit Card Transaction Record - Data Structure Specification

## File

- File: `\src\COTRN01.CPY`

## Summary description

This document outlines the structure of a credit card transaction record within our system. Think of it as the standardized digital form used to capture all the essential details every time a credit card is swiped or used online. 

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version

## Process Description

This code defines how we organize and store critical information about each credit card transaction. It ensures that regardless of where the transaction happens (online, in-store, etc.), we capture data in a consistent way for processing, analysis, and record-keeping.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Transaction Source:** This could be an online store, a physical point-of-sale terminal, or any system initiating a credit card transaction.
2. **Transaction Data:** Basic information about the transaction itself, including the card number, transaction amount, date, and time.

## Validations and Rules

* **Data Type Validation:**  We specify the type of data each field should hold (numbers, text, dates). This ensures data integrity and helps prevent errors during processing.
* **Field Length Validation:** Each data field has a maximum length to ensure consistency and efficient storage. 

## Technical Details

**Data Structure:**

- **`COTRN1AI`:**  The primary layout for the transaction record, using a combination of character and packed-decimal formats for efficient data storage.
- **`COTRN1AO`:** An alternative layout, redefining data fields using different character formats, to support various processing needs.

**Key Data Fields:**

* **`TRNIDINI`:**  Unique Transaction ID
* **`CARDNUMI`:** Credit Card Number
* **`TTYPCDI`:** Transaction Type Code (e.g., purchase, refund)
* **`TRNSRCI`:** Transaction Source (e.g., online, in-store)
* **`TDESCI`:**  Transaction Description 
* **`TRNAMTI`:** Transaction Amount
* **`MIDI`:** Merchant ID
* **`MNAMEI`:** Merchant Name
* **`ERRMSGI`:** Error Message (if any issues occurred)

## Security

* **Data Security:**  While not explicitly defined in this code snippet, the broader system should implement appropriate security measures (encryption, access control) to protect sensitive transaction data.

## Impact on Other Systems

* **Transaction Processing System:** This record format is crucial for authorizing, processing, and settling transactions.
* **Fraud Detection System:**  This data feeds into systems that analyze transactions for suspicious patterns.
* **Reporting and Analytics:**  This information is used to generate reports on transaction volume, trends, and other key business metrics. 

## Models
