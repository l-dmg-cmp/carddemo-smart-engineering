# Card Transaction Data Structure

## Title

- Title Document: Card Transaction Data Structure Specification

## Summary Description

This document outlines the structure of data related to credit card transactions within the CardDemo application. It defines a standardized format for capturing and storing crucial transaction details, ensuring consistency and facilitating efficient processing and analysis.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version

## Process Description

The COTRN02.CPY copybook defines a structured template for recording credit card transactions. Each time a transaction occurs, this template is populated with the specific details of that transaction. The data structure ensures that all transaction information is captured uniformly, creating a comprehensive and auditable record.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Transaction Data:** The system needs to receive data about the credit card transaction, such as the transaction type, date and time, card number, amount, and merchant details.
2. **COBOL Program:** A COBOL program is required to process and populate the transaction data structure defined in the copybook.

## Validations and Rules

* **Data Type Validation:** Each field in the data structure has a defined data type (e.g., numeric, alphanumeric) to ensure data integrity.
* **Format Validation:**  Specific formats may be enforced for certain fields, such as date and time or card number, to maintain consistency.
* **Business Rules:** The system may implement additional business rules for validation, such as checking for valid transaction types or card numbers.

## Technical Details

**Data Structure:**

* **`COTRN2AI`:**  Defines the input transaction data structure.
* **`COTRN2AO`:** Defines the output transaction data structure.

**Data Fields:**

* **`TRNNAMEx`:** Transaction Name (e.g., purchase, refund)
* **`CURDATEx`:**  Date of the transaction
* **`CURTIMEx`:** Time of the transaction
* **`ACTIDINx`:**  Activity ID (unique identifier for the transaction)
* **`CARDNINx`:** Credit Card Number
* **`TTYPCDx`:**  Transaction Type Code
* **`TCATCDx`:** Transaction Category Code
* **`TRNSRCx`:** Transaction Source (e.g., online, POS)
* **`TDESCx`:**  Transaction Description
* **`TRNAMTx`:**  Transaction Amount
* **`TORIGDTx`:** Transaction Origination Date
* **`TPROCDT`:** Transaction Processing Date
* **`MIDx`:**  Merchant ID
* **`MNAMEx`:** Merchant Name
* **`MCITYx`:** Merchant City
* **`MZIPx`:**  Merchant ZIP Code
* **`CONFIRMx`:** Confirmation Status (e.g., approved, declined)
* **`ERRMSGx`:** Error Message (if any)

**Note:** The 'x' in the field names above represents the different formats used for input (I) and output (O) operations.

## Impact on Other Systems

* **Transaction Processing System:** The standardized transaction data structure ensures seamless integration with the transaction processing system.
* **Reporting and Analytics:** The structured data facilitates efficient reporting and analysis of transaction trends.
* **Auditing and Compliance:** The comprehensive data capture supports auditing and regulatory compliance requirements.
