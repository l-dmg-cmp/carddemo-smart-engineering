# **Transaction Handling System**

## Title

- Title Document: Transaction Handling System - Transaction Data Structure Specification

## File

- `COTRN00.CPY`

## Summary description

This document outlines the structure of transaction data within a larger financial system. It acts as a blueprint for how transaction information is organized and standardized, ensuring consistency and reliability in handling financial operations.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version

## Process Description

The `COTRN00.CPY` file defines a standardized format for recording financial transactions, similar to a digital template for capturing transaction details. This ensures uniformity and data integrity across different parts of the system. 

Two main layouts are defined:

* **`COTRN0AI`:**  Represents the internal format for processing transactions.
* **`COTRN0AO`:**  Used for presenting transaction information in reports or displays, with formatting for readability.

Both layouts contain essential fields like transaction ID, date, description, amount, and selection flags.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Transaction Data:** The system requires input of transaction details, likely coming from various sources like user input or other system modules.
2. **Data Validation:** Mechanisms to ensure the accuracy and validity of transaction data before it's processed.
3. **Storage:** A database or file system to store transaction records for future retrieval and analysis.

## Validations and Rules

* **Standardized Format:** All transactions must adhere to the defined format in the copybook, ensuring consistency.
* **Data Type Validation:**  Fields like date, amount, and ID should be validated for correct data types and ranges.
* **Business Rule Enforcement:**  Specific business rules, such as transaction limits or authorization checks, need to be applied.

## Technical Details

**Data Structures:**

* **`COTRN0AI`:**  Internal transaction data structure.
* **`COTRN0AO`:**  Output-oriented transaction data structure.

**Fields (Common to both structures):**

* **`TRNID`:** Unique identifier for each transaction.
* **`TDATE`:** Date of the transaction.
* **`TDESC`:** Description of the transaction.
* **`TAMT`:**  Amount of the transaction.
* **`SEL####`:** Flags to indicate selection or status of specific transactions.

## Security

* **Data Integrity:** The standardized format and validation rules contribute to maintaining data accuracy.
* **Access Control:** Implement mechanisms to restrict access to transaction data based on user roles and permissions.

## Impact on Other Systems

* **Reporting Systems:** The structured data facilitates the generation of accurate financial reports.
* **Auditing:**  Standardized transaction records simplify auditing processes.
* **Integration:**  The consistent format enables easier integration with other systems that rely on transaction data.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| TRNID | String (16) | Unique transaction ID |
| TDATE | Date | Transaction date (YYYYMMDD) |
| TDESC | String (26) | Transaction description |
| TAMT | Decimal (12) | Transaction amount |
| SEL#### | Flag (1) | Selection flag (Y/N) |

## Main References

* **COBOL Programming Language:** The copybook is written in COBOL, dictating data structures.
* **System Architecture:** Understanding the overall system architecture is crucial to see how this copybook fits in.
* **Data Dictionary:** A central repository defining data elements and their meanings would complement this specification.
