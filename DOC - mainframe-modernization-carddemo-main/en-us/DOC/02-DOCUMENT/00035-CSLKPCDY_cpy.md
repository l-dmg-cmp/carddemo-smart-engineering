# Data Integrity Guardian: Ensuring Accurate Phone Numbers, State Codes, and ZIP Codes

## Title Document: Data Integrity Guardian - Lookup Code Repository Specification

## File

- `CSLKPCDY.cpy`

## Summary Description

This document outlines the functionality and business rules of the "Data Integrity Guardian" module, specifically focusing on the lookup code repository (`CSLKPCDY.cpy`). This module plays a crucial role in maintaining data accuracy and consistency by defining acceptable values for phone area codes, US state codes, and US state + first two digits of ZIP code combinations.  This ensures that only valid and standardized data enters the system.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version

## Process Description

The Data Integrity Guardian enforces data integrity through predefined lookup lists. When a user enters data, the system compares it against these lists:

1. **Phone Area Code Validation:**  Verifies if the entered phone area code (e.g., "212") exists in the list of valid North American area codes. This ensures adherence to telecommunications standards.
2. **US State Code Validation:** Checks if the entered two-letter state code (e.g., "NY") is present in the list of valid US state codes. This maintains consistency in address-related data.
3. **State + ZIP Code Validation:** Confirms if the combination of the entered state code and the first two digits of the ZIP code (e.g., "NY10") is geographically valid according to the predefined list. This helps prevent inaccurate address entries.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Predefined Lookup Lists:**  The system requires access to the `CSLKPCDY.cpy` file, which contains the up-to-date lists of valid phone area codes, US state codes, and state + ZIP code combinations.
2. **Data Input:** The process triggers when a user enters phone numbers, state codes, or ZIP codes into the system.

## Validations and Rules

* **Data Integrity:** The primary rule is to ensure data integrity by permitting only values present in the predefined lists. Any discrepancy triggers a validation error.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** The module enforces compliance with North American Numbering Plan (NANPA) regulations for phone area codes and supports address standardization according to postal guidelines.
* **Real-time Validation:** Validation should occur in real-time, preferably during data entry, to provide immediate feedback to the user and prevent incorrect data from being saved.

## Technical Details

**Variables:**

* **`WS-US-PHONE-AREA-CODE-TO-EDIT`:** A three-character variable storing the phone area code entered by the user for validation.
* **`US-STATE-CODE-TO-EDIT`:** A two-character variable holding the US state code entered by the user for validation.
* **`US-STATE-ZIPCODE-TO-EDIT`:** A group variable containing:
    - `US-STATE-AND-FIRST-ZIP2`: A four-character variable holding the state code and the first two digits of the ZIP code.
    - `LAST-3-OF-ZIP`: A three-character variable (currently unused) intended for storing the last three digits of the ZIP code.

**Methods:**

* **`VALID-PHONE-AREA-CODE`:**  A conditional statement (88-level condition in COBOL) that checks if `WS-US-PHONE-AREA-CODE-TO-EDIT` exists in the predefined list of valid phone area codes.
* **`VALID-US-STATE-CODE`:** A conditional statement that verifies if `US-STATE-CODE-TO-EDIT` is present in the list of valid US state codes.
* **`VALID-US-STATE-ZIP-CD2-COMBO`:** A conditional statement that checks if `US-STATE-AND-FIRST-ZIP2` is a valid combination according to the predefined list.

## Security

While not explicitly defined in the code, access to modify the `CSLKPCDY.cpy` file should be strictly controlled to prevent unauthorized changes to these critical validation lists.

## Impact on Other Systems

This module impacts any system component or application that handles phone numbers, US state codes, or ZIP codes. By ensuring data accuracy at the entry point, it contributes to the reliability and integrity of downstream processes, such as:

* **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems**
* **Billing and Invoicing systems**
* **Shipping and Logistics systems**
* **Reporting and Analytics dashboards**
