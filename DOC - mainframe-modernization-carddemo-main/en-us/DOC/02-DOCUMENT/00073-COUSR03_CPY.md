# User Information Management

## Title

- Title Document: User Information Management - COUSR03 Copybook Specification

## File

- `\COUSR03.CPY`

## Summary Description

This document outlines the structure and function of the COUSR03 copybook within a larger COBOL application. This copybook defines how user information is organized and accessed, acting as a blueprint for user data.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial Version

## Process Description

The COUSR03 copybook defines two data layouts (COUSR3AI and COUSR3AO) for handling user information:

1. **COUSR3AI (Internal Format):** This layout is optimized for internal system processing, potentially using a compressed format and different character encoding. 
2. **COUSR3AO (Output Format):** This layout is designed for displaying user information, likely on screens or reports, and uses a more user-friendly format.

Both layouts contain the same essential user data fields but organize them differently for their intended purpose.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **COBOL Application:** This copybook is designed for use within a COBOL application and requires a COBOL compiler and runtime environment. 
2. **Data Storage:** A method for storing and retrieving user data is required, such as VSAM files or a database.

## Validations and Rules

* **Data Types and Lengths:** The copybook defines specific data types (e.g., PIC X for alphanumeric, PIC S9 for signed numeric) and lengths for each field, ensuring data integrity.
* **Uniqueness:**  The `USRIDINI` field (User ID) is expected to be unique for each user, enabling individual user tracking and management.

## Technical Details

**Data Fields:**

* **`USRIDINI`:** User ID (unique identifier for each user)
* **`FNAMEI`:** First Name
* **`LNAMEI`:** Last Name
* **`USRTYPEI`:** User Type (e.g., 'A' for Administrator, 'U' for Regular User)
* **`TRNNAMEI`:** Transaction Name (indicates the system action or process being performed)
* **`PGMNAMEI`:** Program Name (identifies the specific program being used)
* **`CURDATEI`:** Current Date
* **`CURTIMEI`:** Current Time
* **`ERRMSGI`:** Error Message (used to display system messages to the user)

**Methods:**

* This copybook does not define specific methods. It provides a data structure that can be used by programs and functions within the COBOL application.

## Security

* **Access Control:**  Access to user data, especially sensitive fields like `USRTYPEI` (User Type), should be controlled within the COBOL application to prevent unauthorized modifications or disclosure.

## Impact on Other Systems

* **User Management Programs:** Any program within the COBOL application that interacts with user data will rely on the structure defined in this copybook. 
* **Reporting and Auditing:**  The fields within this copybook may be used for generating user activity reports or audit trails.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `USRIDINI` | Alphanumeric (PIC X(8)) | Unique identifier for each user |
| `FNAMEI` | Alphanumeric (PIC X(20)) | User's first name |
| `LNAMEI` | Alphanumeric (PIC X(20)) | User's last name |
| `USRTYPEI` | Alphanumeric (PIC X(1)) | User type (e.g., 'A' for Administrator, 'U' for Regular User) |
| `TRNNAMEI` | Alphanumeric (PIC X(4)) | Transaction name or code |
| `PGMNAMEI` | Alphanumeric (PIC X(8)) | Program name or code |
| `CURDATEI` | Alphanumeric (PIC X(8)) | Current date (YYYYMMDD) |
| `CURTIMEI` | Alphanumeric (PIC X(8)) | Current time (HHMMSS) |
| `ERRMSGI` | Alphanumeric (PIC X(78)) | System message or error message for the user |

## Main References

* **COBOL Programming Language:**  The structure and syntax of this copybook are defined by the COBOL programming language. 
* **VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method):** This copybook's data structure might be used for storing and retrieving user information in VSAM files.
* **Application-Specific Data Dictionary:** The specific meaning and allowed values for fields like `USRTYPEI` (User Type) would be defined in the application's data dictionary or documentation.
