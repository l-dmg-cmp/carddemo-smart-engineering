# Customer Data Specification

## Title

- Title Document: Customer Data Specification - CVCUS01Y Copybook

## File
- `\CVCUS01Y.cpy`

## Summary Description

This document describes the structure of customer information stored within our system. This information is organized using a format called a "copybook," which acts like a template defining what data each customer record can hold. This is particularly important for ensuring consistency and making it easier for different parts of our systems to work with customer data.

## Version History

- CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68: Date: 2022-07-19 23:16:00 CDT

## Process Description

The CVCUS01Y copybook defines the layout for a "CUSTOMER-RECORD." This record is used to store all the essential information about each customer. Each piece of information is assigned a specific field within the record, ensuring data is organized consistently.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1.  **System Using the Copybook:**  Any system or program that needs to work with customer data will need to incorporate this copybook definition.

## Validations and Rules

*   **Data Types:** Each field has a defined data type (e.g., numbers, text) to ensure data integrity.
*   **Field Lengths:** Each field has a maximum length to maintain consistency and storage efficiency.
*   **Unique Customer ID:** The `CUST-ID` is assumed to be a unique identifier for each customer.
*   **Credit Score Usage:** The presence of a `CUST-FICO-CREDIT-SCORE` field suggests this data is used for creditworthiness assessments, making data accuracy crucial.

## Technical Details

**Data Structure:** `CUSTOMER-RECORD`

**Fields:**

*   **`CUST-ID`:** Unique numerical identifier for each customer.
*   **`CUST-FIRST-NAME`, `CUST-MIDDLE-NAME`, `CUST-LAST-NAME`:** Customer's name.
*   **`CUST-ADDR-LINE-1`, `CUST-ADDR-LINE-2`, `CUST-ADDR-LINE-3`, `CUST-ADDR-STATE-CD`, `CUST-ADDR-COUNTRY-CD`, `CUST-ADDR-ZIP`:**  Customer's address.
*   **`CUST-PHONE-NUM-1`, `CUST-PHONE-NUM-2`:** Customer's phone numbers.
*   **`CUST-SSN`:**  Customer's Social Security Number (likely subject to privacy regulations).
*   **`CUST-GOVT-ISSUED-ID`:** Other government-issued identification.
*   **`CUST-DOB-YYYY-MM-DD`:** Customer's date of birth.
*   **`CUST-EFT-ACCOUNT-ID`:** Identifier for electronic funds transfer, likely linked to a banking system.
*   **`CUST-PRI-CARD-HOLDER-IND`:** Indicates if the customer is the primary cardholder, suggesting a link to a credit card account.
*   **`CUST-FICO-CREDIT-SCORE`:** Customer's credit score.

## Impact on Other Systems

*   **Data Integration:** Any system interacting with customer data must adhere to this data structure for seamless integration.
*   **Reporting and Analytics:**  Reports and analysis based on customer data depend on the accuracy and consistency enforced by this specification.

## Main References

*   **COBOL Programming Language:** The copybook format and data definitions are based on the COBOL programming language, indicating a legacy system.

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Data Security:**  Protecting customer data is paramount. Access controls, encryption, and adherence to privacy regulations (e.g., for SSN) are essential.
*   **Data Quality:**  Maintaining data accuracy is crucial, especially for fields like credit score, which can have significant business impacts. Data validation and cleansing procedures are essential.
*   **System Evolution:**  As systems modernize, consider migrating this data structure to more modern formats (e.g., database tables) while ensuring data integrity during the transition.
