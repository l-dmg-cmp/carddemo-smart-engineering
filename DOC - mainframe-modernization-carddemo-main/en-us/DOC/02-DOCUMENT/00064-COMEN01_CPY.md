# **Generic Application Menu System**

## Title

- Title Document: Generic Application Menu System - Common Data Structure Specification

## Summary description

This document outlines the structure and function of the COMEN01.CPY data structure, a crucial component of a menu-driven application. This structure ensures consistent data handling across various application operations, acting as a standardized container for essential information used in user interactions and system processes. 

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version

## Process Description

The COMEN01.CPY data structure defines a template for holding information commonly used throughout the application, including:

1. **Transaction Details:** Captures the name of the current transaction (e.g., "Account View") to track user actions.
2. **Display Information:** Stores titles and headings to present clear and organized information to the user on the screen.
3. **System Variables:** Holds system-level data such as the current date and time, ensuring this information is readily available.
4. **Menu Options:**  Manages the presentation of user choices, allowing for up to twelve options to be displayed and a selection to be recorded.
5. **Error Handling:** Includes a field for storing error messages, facilitating user feedback in case of issues during processing.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **COBOL Compiler:** The structure is defined using the COBOL programming language and requires a compiler for implementation.
2. **Application Context:** This structure is designed to be used within a larger application and relies on the application's logic for data population and processing.

## Validations and Rules

* **Data Types and Lengths:** Each field within the structure has a defined data type (e.g., alphanumeric, numeric) and length restriction to ensure data integrity.
* **Usage Consistency:**  Applications using this structure must adhere to the intended purpose of each field to maintain data consistency and avoid errors.

## Technical Details

**Main Copybook:**

* **`COMEN01.CPY`:**  Defines the data structure layout, including field names, types, and lengths.

**Data Fields:**

* **`TRNNAME`:** Stores the transaction name (e.g., "ACTVW").
* **`TITLE01`:** Holds the primary title or heading for the screen.
* **`CURDATE`:** Contains the current date in various formats.
* **`PGMNAME`:**  Stores the name of the program or module in use.
* **`TITLE02`:** Holds a secondary title or heading.
* **`CURTIME`:** Contains the current time in various formats.
* **`OPTN001` to `OPTN012`:**  Store up to twelve menu options.
* **`OPTION`:** Holds the user's selected option.
* **`ERRMSG`:** Stores error messages for user feedback.

## Security

* **Data Access Control:**  Security measures are not directly implemented within the structure but rely on the encompassing application's security mechanisms to control access to sensitive data.

## Impact on Other Systems

* **Application Modules:** The structure serves as a common point of reference for various modules within the application, ensuring data consistency and simplifying data exchange. 

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| TRNNAME  | Alphanumeric | Transaction name (e.g., "ACTVW"). |
| TITLE01 | Alphanumeric | Primary screen title or heading. |
| CURDATE | Alphanumeric | Current date in various formats. |
| PGMNAME | Alphanumeric |  Name of the program or module in use. |
| TITLE02 | Alphanumeric | Secondary screen title or heading. |
| CURTIME | Alphanumeric | Current time in various formats. |
| OPTN001 - OPTN012 | Alphanumeric | Menu options (up to twelve). |
| OPTION | Alphanumeric | User's selected option. |
| ERRMSG | Alphanumeric | Error messages for user feedback. |

## Main References

* **COBOL Programming Language:**  The structure is defined and used within a COBOL programming environment.


**Additional Considerations:**

* **Internationalization:** If the application requires supporting multiple languages, the structure should be adapted to handle different character sets and lengths for titles and messages. 
* **Screen Handling:** The application needs a mechanism (like BMS maps) to display the data from this structure to the user and capture their input (menu selections). 
* **Error Logging:**  Consider enhancing error handling by logging error details to a file for debugging and auditing.
