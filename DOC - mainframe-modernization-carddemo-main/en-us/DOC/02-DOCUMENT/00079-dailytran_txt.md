# **Daily Transaction Processing System**

## Title

- Title Document: Daily Transaction Processing System - Specification

## File

- File Route: dailytran.txt

## Summary description

This document specifies the requirements for a Daily Transaction Processing System. This system is designed to process daily transaction logs generated by point-of-sale (POS) terminals and operators at various retail store locations. The system will analyze these transactions for sales tracking, inventory management, customer behavior analysis, and operational efficiency improvements.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version

## Process Description

The Daily Transaction Processing System will process the `dailytran.txt` file, which contains a record of each transaction. Each line in the file represents a single transaction and contains details such as transaction type, store location, timestamp, and customer information. The system will parse and validate this data, then use it for various business analyses.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Daily Transaction File (`dailytran.txt`):** The system requires a daily transaction file generated by the POS system.
2. **Database:** A database to store parsed transaction data for further analysis and reporting.
3. **Business Rules:** Clear definitions of business rules for data validation, sales tracking, inventory management, and customer behavior analysis.

## Validations and Rules of the Process

**Data Validation:**

* **Transaction Type:** Validate that each transaction type is either "Purchase" or "Return".
* **Location:** Validate store location information against a master list of store locations.
* **Timestamp:** Validate timestamp format and ensure chronological order within the file.
* **Customer Information:** If available, validate customer information against a customer database.

**Business Rules:**

* **Sales Tracking:** Calculate total sales, sales by product, sales by store location, and identify sales trends.
* **Inventory Management:** Update inventory levels based on purchases and returns. Identify stock shortages and generate alerts.
* **Customer Behavior:** Analyze customer purchase patterns, frequency, and average transaction value.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Identify peak hours for each store location, analyze transaction processing times, and generate reports for staff optimization.

## Technical Details

**Main Classes:**

* **`TransactionProcessor`:** The main class responsible for reading, parsing, and validating transaction data from the `dailytran.txt` file.
* **`SalesAnalyzer`:** Class responsible for analyzing sales data and generating reports.
* **`InventoryManager`:** Class responsible for updating inventory levels and generating stock alerts.
* **`CustomerBehaviorAnalyzer`:** Class responsible for analyzing customer purchase patterns.
* **`OperationalEfficiencyAnalyzer`:** Class responsible for analyzing operational data like peak hours and transaction processing times.

**Main Functions/Methods:**

* **`ProcessTransactionFile(string filePath)`:**  Main function to initiate the processing of the `dailytran.txt` file.
* **`ParseTransactionLine(string line)`:**  Parses a single line from the transaction file and extracts data into relevant fields.
* **`ValidateTransactionData(Transaction transaction)`:**  Validates the extracted transaction data against defined rules.
* **`StoreTransactionData(Transaction transaction)`:**  Stores validated transaction data into the database.

**Variables:**

* **`transactionType`:** String variable storing the type of transaction ("Purchase" or "Return").
* **`storeLocation`:** Object variable storing store name, address, and other location details.
* **`timestamp`:** Datetime variable storing the date and time of the transaction.
* **`customerInfo`:** Object variable storing customer details (if available).

## Impact on Other Systems

* **Point-of-Sale System:** The system relies on the POS system to generate the daily transaction file (`dailytran.txt`).
* **Inventory Management System:**  The system updates inventory levels, which may impact the existing inventory management system.
* **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System:**  Customer behavior analysis data can be integrated with the CRM system for targeted marketing and customer segmentation.
* **Reporting and Analytics Dashboard:** The system will provide data for various business reports and dashboards used by management for decision-making.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Transaction Type | String | Type of transaction (Purchase or Return). |
| Store Name | String | Name of the store location. |
| Store Address | String | Address of the store location. |
| Store Zip Code | String | Zip code of the store location. |
| Timestamp | Datetime | Date and time of the transaction. |
| Customer ID | String (Optional) | Unique identifier for the customer (if available). |
| Product ID | String | Unique identifier for the product involved in the transaction. |
| Quantity | Integer | Quantity of the product involved in the transaction. |
| Price | Decimal | Price of the product. |
| Total Amount | Decimal | Total amount of the transaction. |

## Main References

* **Point-of-Sale System Documentation:**  Detailed documentation of the POS system, including transaction file format and data fields.
* **Business Requirements Documentation:**  Clearly defined business rules and requirements for sales tracking, inventory management, customer behavior analysis, and operational efficiency reporting.
* **Database Schema:**  Definition of the database schema used to store transaction data.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling to capture invalid data and generate appropriate logs and reports.
* **Data Security:** Ensure data security and access control to protect sensitive customer and transaction information.
* **Scalability:**  Design the system to handle increasing transaction volumes as the business grows.
* **Performance:**  Optimize the system for performance to ensure efficient processing of large transaction files.

**Note:** This specification is based on the provided code snippet and limited information. For a complete specification, additional details about the system's architecture, integration with other systems, data models, and security requirements are needed.
