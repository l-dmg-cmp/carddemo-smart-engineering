## Title

- Title Document: Credit Card Management System - Account Data Specification

## File

- File Route: `ACCTDAT` (VSAM file)

## Summary description

This document outlines the structure and content of the `ACCTDAT` file, a critical component of the Credit Card Management System. This file serves as a centralized repository for all customer account information, storing details such as account numbers, balances, credit limits, and status. Maintaining the accuracy, security, and integrity of this data is paramount for the system's operational efficiency and regulatory compliance. 

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version

## Process Description

The `ACCTDAT` file is accessed and updated by various programs within the Credit Card Management System to perform core functions:

1. **Account Creation:** When a new credit card account is opened, a new record is added to `ACCTDAT` capturing the initial account details.
2. **Account Updates:** Programs like `COACTUPC` (Account Update) modify existing records in `ACCTDAT`  when changes are made to account information, such as address changes or credit limit adjustments.
3. **Transaction Processing:**  Programs handling transactions, such as payments or purchases, read and update relevant account balances and transaction histories stored in `ACCTDAT`.
4. **Report Generation:** Batch processes and reporting programs extract data from `ACCTDAT` to generate summaries, statements, and analytical reports for various business needs. 

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **VSAM Environment:** The system must have a properly configured VSAM environment to store and manage the `ACCTDAT` file.
2. **Authorized Access:**  Access to the `ACCTDAT` file is restricted to authorized programs and personnel only.
3. **Data Integrity Controls:** Mechanisms for ensuring data accuracy, consistency, and completeness are essential.

## Validations and Rules

* **Data Validation:** Programs writing to `ACCTDAT` must perform rigorous data validation to prevent invalid or inaccurate information from being stored.
* **Concurrent Access Control:**  The system needs to manage concurrent access to `ACCTDAT` from multiple programs to prevent data corruption.
* **Auditing and Logging:** All access and modifications to `ACCTDAT` should be logged for auditing and traceability purposes. 

## Technical Details

**File Structure:**  The `ACCTDAT` file is a VSAM KSDS (Key-Sequenced Dataset) file. 
* Each record in the file represents a single customer account.
* Records are identified and accessed using a unique key, likely the account number.
* The file is organized sequentially based on this key for efficient retrieval and processing.

**Data Fields (Illustrative):**
* **Account Number:** Unique identifier for each account.
* **Customer Name:**  Name of the account holder.
* **Credit Limit:** The maximum credit available to the account.
* **Current Balance:** The current outstanding balance on the account.
* **Account Status:**  Indicates whether the account is active, closed, suspended, etc. 
* **Last Statement Date:** Date of the last statement generated.
* **Payment Due Date:** Date when the next payment is due. 
* **Transaction History:** A record of recent transactions (may be stored in a separate file). 

**Methods (Illustrative):**
* **READ:**  Retrieves a specific record from the file based on the account number.
* **WRITE:**  Adds a new record to the file or updates an existing one.
* **DELETE:**  Removes a record from the file (may be logical deletion marking the record inactive).

## Security

* **Access Control:**  Strict access control mechanisms are implemented to restrict file access to authorized programs and users.
* **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data within the `ACCTDAT` file, such as account numbers and balances, should be encrypted at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized disclosure.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Periodic security audits should be conducted to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

## Impact on Other Systems

* **All Credit Card Management System Programs:** The `ACCTDAT` file is central to the entire system's operation, impacting all programs involved in account management, transaction processing, reporting, and customer service.

| Credit Limit        | Numeric  | Maximum credit available on the account.      |
| Current Balance     | Numeric  | Current outstanding balance on the account.  |
| Account Status      | Code     | Active, Closed, Suspended, etc.               |
| Last Statement Date | Date     | Date of the last statement generated.     |
| Payment Due Date    | Date     | Date the next payment is due.              |

## Main References

* **VSAM Documentation:** Refer to IBM's VSAM documentation for details on file management, access methods, and security.
* **COBOL Programs:** The COBOL programs interacting with `ACCTDAT` (e.g., `COACTUPC`, `COTRN00C`, batch programs) provide further context on data usage. 

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Data Backup and Recovery:**  Implement robust backup and recovery procedures to ensure data availability in case of system failures.
* **Performance Optimization:**  Regularly monitor and optimize file access patterns and indexing strategies for optimal performance.
* **Data Archiving:**  Develop a strategy for archiving inactive or historical account data to manage file size and performance.
