# Card Account Cross-Reference Data File Processor

## Title

- Title Document: Card Account Cross-Reference Data File Processor - CBACT03C

## File

- `\src\CBACT03C.cbl`

## Summary Description:

This program reads and displays the contents of a file containing cross-referenced credit card account information. It's a batch process, meaning it runs in the background without direct user interaction. Think of it like an automated report generator for this specific data.

## Version History

- CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68 (July 19, 2022): Initial version

## Process Description

1. **Open File:**  The program locates and opens the cross-reference data file.
2. **Read Record:** It reads a single record from the file.
3. **Display Record:**  The content of the record is displayed. This could be on a screen, written to another file, or sent to a printer, depending on how the program is configured.
4. **Repeat:** Steps 2 and 3 are repeated for every record in the file until it reaches the end.
5. **Close File:** The program closes the cross-reference data file.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Existence of Cross-Reference Data File:** The program relies on the presence of a file containing the cross-referenced card account data. This file must be correctly structured and accessible to the program.

## Validations and Rules

* **File Structure:** The program assumes a specific structure for the cross-reference data file. Any deviations in this structure could lead to incorrect data processing or program errors.
* **Sequential Processing:** The program processes records in the order they are stored in the file.

## Technical Details

**Variables:**

* **`XREFFILE-FILE`:** Represents the physical file containing the cross-referenced card account data.
* **`CARD-XREF-RECORD`:**  A data structure holding the information read from each record in the file. It likely contains fields like account number, card number, and other relevant cross-reference details.
* **`XREFFILE-STATUS`:**  A two-character field indicating the status of the file operations (open, read, close). A value of '00' usually means success. 
* **`END-OF-FILE`:** A flag (a variable that indicates a specific condition) that is set to 'Y' when the program reaches the end of the data file, signaling the process to stop.

**Methods:** 

* **`1000-XREFFILE-GET-NEXT`:**  This section handles reading a record from the file and checking for errors or end-of-file conditions.
* **`0000-XREFFILE-OPEN`:** This section handles opening the file and checking for successful opening.
* **`9000-XREFFILE-CLOSE`:** This section handles closing the file and checking for successful closing.
* **`9910-DISPLAY-IO-STATUS`:** This section handles displaying the file status (errors or success codes) in a user-friendly format.
* **`9999-ABEND-PROGRAM`:** This section handles the abnormal termination of the program if a severe error occurs.

## Security

- No specific security measures are mentioned in the provided code.

## Impact on Other Systems

- This program likely has minimal impact on other systems as it primarily focuses on reading and displaying data. However, its output might be used by other processes or systems.

## Models

| Name Field                | Type | Description                                            |
|---------------------------|------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| FD-XREF-CARD-NUM          | PIC X(16) | Credit card number (16 digits)                         |
| FD-XREF-DATA              | PIC X(34) | Additional cross-reference data (34 characters)       |

## Main References

* **`XREFFILE`:**  The external file containing the cross-referenced credit card account data.
* **`CVACT03Y`:**  A separate COBOL program or a copybook (a file containing reusable code) referenced in this program. It likely contains the definition of the `CARD-XREF-RECORD` structure.
