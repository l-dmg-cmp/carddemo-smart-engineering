# Credit Card Transaction Record Specification

## Title

- Title Document: Credit Card Transaction Record - Data Structure Specification

## Summary Description

This document outlines the structure of a credit card transaction record within a COBOL-based financial system. It defines the data fields, their formats, and their purposes, ensuring standardized and consistent transaction data capture.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68 (July 19, 2022)

## Process Description

The `CVTRA05Y.cpy` file defines a COBOL copybook, which acts as a template for a transaction record. This template ensures that each transaction is recorded uniformly, containing all necessary information for processing, analysis, and auditing.

## Requirements to Start the Process

- **COBOL Compiler:** The system must have a COBOL compiler to interpret and integrate this copybook definition.
- **Data Storage:** A data storage mechanism (likely VSAM) is required to store the transaction records.

## Validations and Rules

- **Data Types and Lengths:** Each data field has a specific data type (e.g., alphanumeric, numeric) and length restriction, ensuring data integrity.
- **Unique Transaction ID:** Each transaction must have a unique identifier (`TRAN-ID`) to distinguish it from others.
- **Transaction Type and Category Codes:** Standardized codes are used to categorize transactions by type and category, facilitating analysis and reporting.

## Technical Details

**Variables:**

- `TRAN-ID`: A 16-character alphanumeric field representing the unique Transaction ID.
- `TRAN-TYPE-CD`: A 2-character alphanumeric field representing the Transaction Type Code (e.g., "SA" for Sale, "CR" for Credit).
- `TRAN-CAT-CD`: A 4-digit numeric field representing the Transaction Category Code (e.g., "5010" for Grocery Purchases).
- `TRAN-SOURCE`: A 10-character alphanumeric field indicating the Transaction Source (e.g., "POS Terminal").
- `TRAN-DESC`: A 100-character alphanumeric field providing a brief Transaction Description.
- `TRAN-AMT`: A 9-digit numeric field with two decimal places representing the Transaction Amount.
- `TRAN-MERCHANT-ID`: A 9-digit numeric field representing the Merchant ID.
- `TRAN-MERCHANT-NAME`: A 50-character alphanumeric field containing the Merchant Name.
- `TRAN-MERCHANT-CITY`: A 50-character alphanumeric field containing the Merchant City.
- `TRAN-MERCHANT-ZIP`: A 10-character alphanumeric field containing the Merchant ZIP code.
- `TRAN-CARD-NUM`: A 16-character alphanumeric field representing the Card Number used.
- `TRAN-ORIG-TS`: A 26-character alphanumeric field recording the original Transaction Timestamp.
- `TRAN-PROC-TS`: A 26-character alphanumeric field recording the Transaction Processing Timestamp.

## Impact on Other Systems

- **Transaction Processing:** This record structure is crucial for processing transactions, ensuring all necessary data is captured.
- **Reporting and Analysis:** The standardized format enables efficient querying, reporting, and analysis of transaction data.
- **Auditing:**  The detailed information and timestamps facilitate auditing and tracking of financial transactions.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| TRAN-ID | Alphanumeric (X) | Unique identifier for the transaction (16 characters) |
| TRAN-TYPE-CD | Alphanumeric (X) | Two-character code indicating the nature of the transaction (e.g., "SA" for sale, "CR" for credit) |
| TRAN-CAT-CD | Numeric (9) | Four-digit code providing a specific categorization of the transaction (e.g., "5010" for grocery purchases) |
| TRAN-SOURCE | Alphanumeric (X) | Identifies the origin of the transaction (e.g., "POS terminal," "Online Payment Gateway") (10 characters) |
| TRAN-DESC | Alphanumeric (X) | Brief description of the transaction (100 characters) |
| TRAN-AMT | Numeric (S9V99) | Monetary value of the transaction (9 digits with 2 decimal places) |
| TRAN-MERCHANT-ID | Numeric (9) | Unique identifier for the merchant (9 digits) |
| TRAN-MERCHANT-NAME | Alphanumeric (X) | Name of the merchant (50 characters) |
| TRAN-MERCHANT-CITY | Alphanumeric (X) | City of the merchant (50 characters) |
| TRAN-MERCHANT-ZIP | Alphanumeric (X) | ZIP code of the merchant (10 characters) |
| TRAN-CARD-NUM | Alphanumeric (X) | Credit card number used for the transaction (16 characters) |
| TRAN-ORIG-TS | Alphanumeric (X) | Timestamp of the original transaction (26 characters) |
| TRAN-PROC-TS | Alphanumeric (X) | Timestamp of when the transaction was processed (26 characters) |
