# CardDemo Application - Screen Titles and Messages Specification

## Title Document: CardDemo Application - Screen Titles and Messages Specification

## File

- `COTTL01Y.cpy`

## Summary description

This document outlines the specifications for displaying titles and messages within the CardDemo application, a COBOL-based credit card management system. The primary objective is to enhance the user experience by presenting clear, consistent branding and user-friendly messages throughout the application. 

## Version History

- `CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68` Date: 2022-07-19 23:15:58 CDT

## Process Description

The `COTTL01Y.cpy` file defines the text strings used for the application's title lines and a thank-you message displayed to the user.  These strings are likely displayed on various screens within the application to maintain a consistent look and feel.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **COBOL Compiler:** Requires a COBOL compiler to integrate the copybook containing these strings into the application's source code.
2. **CICS Environment:** The application must be running within a CICS environment, as this influences how the titles and messages are displayed.

## Validations and Rules

* **Display Logic:** The application must include logic to retrieve and display these strings appropriately based on user actions and screen flow.
* **String Length:**  The defined lengths of the strings (40 characters) must be respected to avoid truncation or display issues.

## Technical Details

**Variables:**

* **`CCDA-TITLE01`**: Contains the first line of the application title, "AWS Mainframe Modernization".
* **`CCDA-TITLE02`**:  Contains the second line of the application title, "CardDemo".
* **`CCDA-THANK-YOU`**:  Contains a thank-you message displayed to the user upon exiting the application.

## Security

N/A - This component focuses on user interface elements and does not directly involve sensitive data or security functions.

## Impact on Other Systems

N/A - This component is self-contained and does not directly impact other systems. It provides text strings for display within the CardDemo application.

## Models

N/A - This component does not define any specific data models. It provides text strings for display purposes.

## Main References

* **CICS Screen Handling:** The display of these titles and messages will depend on how the application handles screen interactions within the CICS environment.
* **COBOL Copybooks:** Understanding COBOL copybooks is essential for integrating these strings into other parts of the application's code.
