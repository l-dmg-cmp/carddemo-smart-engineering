# **CardDemo Transaction Type Management**

## Title

- Title Document: CardDemo Transaction Type Management - Data Structure Specification

## File

- `\CVTRA03Y.cpy`

## Summary description

This document outlines the structure and purpose of the `TRAN-TYPE-RECORD` data structure within the CardDemo application. This structure is crucial for categorizing and describing different types of credit card transactions, ensuring accurate processing and reporting.

## Version History

- `CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68`: Initial implementation of the transaction type data structure.

## Process Description

The `TRAN-TYPE-RECORD` defines a standardized format for representing transaction types within the CardDemo system. 

1. **Structure Definition:**  The code establishes a structured format called "TRAN-TYPE-RECORD" to hold information about each transaction type.
2. **Type Code Assignment:** Each transaction type is assigned a unique two-character code (e.g., "SA" for Sale, "RT" for Return) for efficient processing and storage.
3. **Description Provision:** A descriptive label is associated with each transaction type code to enhance readability and understanding.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Defined Transaction Types:** A predefined list of transaction types relevant to the credit card system.
2. **Unique Codes:**  Each transaction type must have a unique two-character code.

## Validations and Rules

* **Transaction Classification:** All credit card transactions recorded in the system must be associated with a defined transaction type.
* **Code Uniqueness:** Each transaction type code must be unique to avoid ambiguity.
* **Description Clarity:** The description for each transaction type should be concise, meaningful, and easily understandable.

## Technical Details

**Variables:**

* **`TRAN-TYPE-RECORD`:** The main data structure holding information about a transaction type.
* **`TRAN-TYPE`:**  A two-character code representing the transaction type (e.g., "SA", "RT").
* **`TRAN-TYPE-DESC`:**  A descriptive label for the transaction type (e.g., "Sale", "Return").

## Impact on Other Systems

* **Transaction Processing:**  The `TRAN-TYPE-RECORD` structure is essential for categorizing and processing transactions accurately.
* **Reporting and Analysis:** The standardized transaction types and descriptions facilitate reporting and analysis of transaction data.
* **Auditing and Compliance:** The use of defined transaction types aids in auditing and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TRAN-TYPE` | String (2 characters) | Unique code representing a specific transaction type. |
| `TRAN-TYPE-DESC` | String (50 characters) | Descriptive label for the transaction type, providing a clear explanation of its meaning. |

## Main References

* **CardDemo Data Dictionary:** For a complete list of defined transaction types and their corresponding codes and descriptions.

## Additional Considerations

* **Extensibility:** The system should be designed to accommodate the addition of new transaction types in the future.
* **Data Integrity:** Ensure data integrity by enforcing the association of each transaction with a valid transaction type.
* **Standardization:**  Adhere to industry standards for transaction type codes and descriptions whenever possible.
