## Summary description

This document outlines the structure and data elements within the `TRAN-CAT-BAL-RECORD` record, which is crucial for understanding how the system stores and tracks balances for various transaction categories. This information is vital for financial reporting and analysis.

## Version History

- CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68: Initial version - July 19, 2022

## Process Description

The system uses the `TRAN-CAT-BAL-RECORD` structure to maintain a detailed record of the balance for every category of transaction.  This structure ensures that each transaction is categorized by account, type, and a specific category code, and that a running balance is maintained for each unique combination.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1.  **Transaction Data:** The system requires accurate and timely transaction data, including the account ID, transaction type code, category code, and transaction amount.
2.  **Account Data:**  Access to account information is necessary to validate account IDs and retrieve relevant account details.
3.  **Transaction Category Mapping:** A mapping table or logic is required to associate each transaction with its corresponding category code.

## Validations and Rules

*   **Account ID Validation:**  The system should validate the account ID against existing account records to prevent errors and ensure data integrity.
*   **Transaction Type Validation:** The transaction type code should be validated against a predefined list of valid codes.
*   **Category Code Validation:** The category code should be validated to ensure it aligns with the defined transaction categories.
*   **Balance Calculation:** The system must accurately calculate and update the balance for each transaction category based on the transaction amount.

## Technical Details

**Variables:**

*   **`TRANCAT-ACCT-ID`:**  An 11-digit number that uniquely identifies each account.
*   **`TRANCAT-TYPE-CD`:** A 2-character code (e.g., 'SA', 'CH') representing the type of account or transaction.
*   **`TRANCAT-CD`:**  A 4-digit code (e.g., '0001', '0002') that categorizes the transaction into a specific type within its broader category.
*   **`TRAN-CAT-BAL`:** A numeric field with up to 9 digits and 2 decimal places that stores the calculated balance for each specific transaction category.

## Impact on Other Systems

*   **Reporting Systems:** This data is essential for generating accurate financial reports, including balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements.
*   **Analytics Systems:**  The transaction category balance information can be used for trend analysis, identifying spending patterns, and making informed financial decisions.
*   **Auditing Systems:**  This data is crucial for audit trails, ensuring the accuracy and accountability of financial transactions.

| `TRANCAT-TYPE-CD`    | Text(2)      | A code specifying the type of account or transaction (e.g., 'SA' for savings, 'CH' for checking).                                                            |
| `TRANCAT-CD`         | Numeric(4)  | A more specific code for the transaction category (e.g., '0001' for ATM withdrawals, '0002' for online transfers).                                           |
| `TRAN-CAT-BAL`       | Decimal(9,2) | The actual balance for the specific transaction category.                                                                                                       |
