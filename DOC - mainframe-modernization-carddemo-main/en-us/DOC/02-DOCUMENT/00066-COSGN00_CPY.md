# User Login Information Management

## Title

- Title Document: User Login Information Management

## File

- `\COSGN00.CPY`

## Summary Description

This document outlines the structure and business rules governing the storage and handling of user login information within the system.  It focuses on data organization, security, and integrity.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial Version

## Process Description

This code defines how the system manages user login information. This information is organized into a structured format, ensuring efficient storage, retrieval, and overall data integrity.

## Requirements to Start the Process

* User provides User ID and Password.
* System needs to validate User ID and Password against stored credentials.

## Validations and Rules

* **Secure Storage:** User IDs and passwords are treated as sensitive data and their storage should be secure to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Error Handling:**  The system should provide clear error messages to the user in case of invalid login attempts, such as incorrect User ID or password.
* **Data Integrity:**  The system should ensure the consistency and accuracy of user login information stored and accessed.

## Technical Details

**Data Structures:**

* **COSGN0AI:** This structure defines the format for receiving user login information. It includes fields for:
    - Transaction Name (e.g., login, logout)
    - Screen Titles (for display purposes)
    - Date and Time of the action
    - User ID
    - Password
    - Error Message (if applicable)
* **COSGN0AO:** This structure uses the `REDEFINES` clause to provide an alternate view of the data stored in `COSGN0AI`. This allows the system to interpret the same data in different ways depending on the context.

## Security

* **Secure Storage:** The specification emphasizes the secure storage of user credentials (User ID and Password), highlighting their critical role in system access and security. Measures should be taken to protect this information from unauthorized access.

## Impact on Other Systems

The User Login Information Management process is crucial for any system functionality that requires user authentication. Any system component relying on user identification and access control will be impacted.
