# Credit Card Duplicate Check Data Structure

## Title

- Title Document: Credit Card Duplicate Check Data Structure Specification

## File

- File: \src\COCRDUP.CPY

## Summary Description

This document outlines the structure of credit card information used for detecting duplicates within our system. It defines how this data is organized, both for internal processing and user display, ensuring data integrity and facilitating duplicate checks.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version.

## Process Description

This code defines two data structures, `CCRDUPAI` and `CCRDUPAO`, that act as templates for handling credit card information during duplicate checks. These structures contain fields for storing various data points related to a credit card, such as transaction details, credit card information, and system messages.

1. **Internal Processing (`CCRDUPAI`):** This structure organizes data in a format optimized for system processing.
2. **User Display (`CCRDUPAO`):** This structure presents the same data in a user-friendly format for display on screens.

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Credit Card Data:**  The system needs to have access to the credit card data that needs to be checked for duplicates. This data should include elements defined in the data structures.

## Validations and Rules

- **Data Integrity:** The defined structures ensure that credit card information is consistently stored and processed, minimizing errors.
- **Duplicate Prevention:** The structured format of credit card data facilitates the process of checking for duplicates, preventing fraud and maintaining system accuracy.
- **User-Friendliness:**  While the system works with data efficiently, users can still view and interact with it in an understandable format due to the separate structures for internal processing and display.

## Technical Details

**Data Structures:**

- **`CCRDUPAI`:**  Structure for internal processing of credit card data.
- **`CCRDUPAO`:**  Structure for displaying credit card data to users.

**Fields (Common to both structures):**

- **`TRNNAME`:** Transaction name (e.g., "Purchase", "Refund").
- **`TITLE01`:**  Title or header for the first section of information.
- **`CURDATE`:** Current date.
- **`PGMNAME`:** Name of the program or module.
- **`TITLE02`:** Title or header for the second section of information.
- **`CURTIME`:** Current time.
- **`ACCTSID`:** Account ID associated with the credit card.
- **`CARDSID`:** Credit card number.
- **`CRDNAME`:** Cardholder's name.
- **`CRDSTCD`:** Credit card status code (e.g., "Active", "Blocked").
- **`EXPMON`:**  Credit card expiry month.
- **`EXPYEAR`:** Credit card expiry year.
- **`EXPDAY`:** Credit card expiry day.
- **`INFOMSG`:** Informational messages for the user.
- **`ERRMSG`:** Error messages.
- **`FKEYS`:** Function keys available for user interaction.
- **`FKEYSC`:**  Function key descriptions.

## Security

- **Data Protection:**  While not explicitly defined in this code snippet, the system should implement appropriate security measures (e.g., encryption, access control) to protect sensitive credit card information during all stages of processing.

## Impact on Other Systems

- **Credit Card Processing System:** This code directly impacts the credit card processing system, ensuring data consistency and enabling duplicate checks.
- **User Interface:** The user interface will use the `CCRDUPAO` structure to display credit card information clearly.
- **Reporting and Auditing:**  The structured data facilitates generating reports and audit trails related to credit card transactions and duplicate checks.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| TRNNAME | String | Transaction name (e.g., "Purchase", "Refund"). |
| TITLE01 | String | Title or header for the first section of information. |
| CURDATE | Date | Current date. |
| PGMNAME | String | Name of the program or module. |
| TITLE02 | String | Title or header for the second section of information. |
| CURTIME | Time | Current time. |
| ACCTSID | String | Account ID associated with the credit card. |
| CARDSID | String | Credit card number. |
| CRDNAME | String | Cardholder's name. |
| CRDSTCD | String | Credit card status code (e.g., "Active", "Blocked"). |
| EXPMON | Integer | Credit card expiry month. |
| EXPYEAR | Integer | Credit card expiry year. |
| EXPDAY | Integer | Credit card expiry day. |
| INFOMSG | String | Informational messages for the user. |
| ERRMSG | String | Error messages. |
| FKEYS | String | Function keys available for user interaction. |
| FKEYSC | String | Function key descriptions. |
