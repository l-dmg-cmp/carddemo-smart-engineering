# Credit Card Data Extraction and Validation 

## Title

- Title Document: Credit Card Data Extraction and Validation - Specification

## Summary description

This document outlines the requirements for a program designed to extract, validate, and process credit card information from a text file named `carddata.txt`. The program aims to ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and compliance with industry standards like PCI DSS for handling sensitive credit card data.

## Version History

- Version 1.0: Initial version

## Process Description

The program will execute the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction:** Read and parse the `carddata.txt` file line by line.
2. **Data Validation:** Validate each credit card record for:
    - Valid card number format (using Luhn's Algorithm)
    - Card number length 
    - Expiration date format and validity
3. **Data Storage (Optional):**  Based on future requirements, the validated data may be stored securely in a database or other persistent storage.
4. **Reporting:** Generate reports or logs, potentially including:
    -  Number of records processed
    -  Number of invalid records and reasons for invalidity
    -  Potentially anonymized summaries of valid card data (e.g., card type distribution)

## Requirements to Start the Process

1. **Input File:** The `carddata.txt` file containing credit card information.
2. **Programming Language and Framework:** Selection of a suitable programming language (e.g., Python, Java) and potentially a framework for data processing and validation.

## Validations and Rules

* **Luhn's Algorithm:** Implement Luhn's Algorithm to validate the credit card numbers.
* **Card Number Length:** Check if the card number length meets standard requirements (typically 13-19 digits).
* **Expiration Date Format:** Validate the expiration date format (YYYY-MM-DD).
* **Future Date Validation:** Ensure the expiration date is a future date.
* **Data Confidentiality:** Implement measures to protect sensitive credit card information during processing and storage (e.g., data masking, encryption).
* **Compliance:** Adhere to PCI DSS standards for handling credit card information.

## Technical Details

**Main Classes/Modules:**

* **`CardDataExtractor`:** Responsible for reading and extracting data from the `carddata.txt` file.
* **`CardValidator`:** Contains functions to perform validations on the extracted card data.
* **`ReportGenerator`:**  Generates reports on processed data.

**Main Functions/Methods:**

* **`extract_card_data(file_path)`:**  Reads the input file and returns a list of card data records.
* **`is_valid_card_number(card_number)`:** Implements Luhn's Algorithm to check card number validity.
* **`is_valid_expiration_date(expiration_date)`:** Checks expiration date format and validity.
* **`generate_processing_report(processed_data)`:** Creates a report summarizing the data processing.

**Variables:**

* **`card_number`:** String representing the credit card number.
* **`customer_name`:** String storing the customer's name.
* **`expiration_date`:** String representing the card's expiration date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

## Security

* **Data Minimization:** Only process and store the minimum necessary credit card data required for the specific purpose.
* **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. 
* **Secure Storage:**  If storing credit card data, use a secure and compliant storage solution.
* **Access Control:**  Restrict access to credit card data to authorized personnel only.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits to ensure compliance and identify vulnerabilities.

## Impact on Other Systems

* **Data Storage:** The program might interact with a database or other storage systems if data persistence is required.
* **Reporting Systems:** The generated reports could be integrated with existing reporting or monitoring systems.

## Models

| Name Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| card_number | String | Credit card number (13-19 digits) |
| customer_name | String | Customer's full name |
| expiration_date | Date | Expiration date of the credit card (YYYY-MM-DD) |

## Main References

* **Luhn's Algorithm:**  Standard algorithm for validating credit card numbers.
* **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard):**  Set of security standards for organizations that handle branded credit cards.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:**  Implement comprehensive error handling to manage file read errors, invalid data formats, and other potential issues.
* **Logging:**  Log events, errors, and potentially anonymized processing information for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.
* **Performance:**  Optimize for performance, especially when handling large data files.
* **Scalability:** Design the solution to be scalable to accommodate potential increases in data volume.
