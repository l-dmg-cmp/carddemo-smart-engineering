**Title Document:** CardDemo Transaction Type Data Structure Specification

**Summary Description:**
This document describes the `TRAN-TYPE-RECORD` data structure used in the CardDemo application. This structure defines the format for storing information about different transaction types, including a two-character code and a fifty-character description. This structure is important for classifying and describing various credit card transactions, which is crucial for accurate processing, reporting, and analysis.

**User Stories:**
As a data analyst, I need to be able to easily identify and understand the different types of transactions in the system so that I can perform accurate analysis and reporting.
