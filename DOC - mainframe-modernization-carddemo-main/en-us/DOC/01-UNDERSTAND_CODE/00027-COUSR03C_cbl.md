## Decoding User Deletion in CardDemo: A Look at COUSR03C

**File:** \src\COUSR03C.cbl

**Context:**

This code forms the backbone of the user deletion process within the CardDemo application, a system likely used for managing credit card operations.  Think of it as the digital equivalent of removing a user's access card.

**Action:**

1. **User Identification:** The process begins when an authorized user (likely an administrator) wants to remove a user from the system.  They provide the User ID of the account to be deleted.
2. **Confirmation Check:** Before proceeding, the system retrieves and displays the details of the specified user, allowing the administrator to confirm they are deleting the correct account.
3. **Deletion Execution:** Upon confirmation (typically by pressing a specific function key), the code removes the user's record from the 'USRSEC' file (likely where user credentials are stored).
4. **Result Communication:** The system then confirms the successful deletion, providing a clear message to the administrator.  Any errors encountered during the process, such as an invalid User ID, are also communicated.

**Business Rules:**

* **Security & Authorization:** Only authorized users should be able to delete accounts, ensuring the system's security. This usually involves an authentication step before accessing this functionality.
* **Data Integrity:** The system confirms the User ID before deletion to avoid accidental removal of the wrong account, maintaining the integrity of the user database.
* **Audit Trail:**  While not explicitly shown in this code, deleting a user should ideally be logged for auditing purposes.  This record would include details like who deleted the account and when, crucial for tracking actions within the system.
* **User Deactivation vs. Deletion:**  Businesses often have policies regarding user data retention.  Instead of permanent deletion, consider a 'deactivation' flag that renders the account unusable without removing the data itself.  This approach can be helpful for compliance and reporting purposes.
