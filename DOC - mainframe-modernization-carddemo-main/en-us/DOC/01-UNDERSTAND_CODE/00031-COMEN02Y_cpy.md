##  CardDemo Application: Admin Menu Options

**File:**  \COMEN02Y.cpy

**Context:**

This code defines the menu options available to administrators in the CardDemo application.  Think of it as the control panel for managing various aspects of the credit card system.

**Action:**

	**Structure:** The code is structured as a list, with each item representing a menu option.  Each option has a number, a name that users see, a code for the system to identify it, and a user type (always 'U' for user, in this case).
	**Functionality:** This code itself doesn't perform actions but acts as a blueprint. When an admin logs in, the application uses this code to display the menu (Account View, Account Update, Credit Card List, etc.) and then runs the corresponding program based on the admin's selection. 
	**Technologies:** This uses COBOL, a programming language common in financial systems and often found on mainframes.
	**Best Practices:**  Using a separate file for menu options is good practice as it allows changes to the menu without directly modifying the main application logic.
	**Improvements:**  The menu structure could be made more dynamic. Instead of hardcoding options here, a database-driven approach would allow for easier updates and even personalized menus based on user roles. 

**Business Rules:**

* **Admin-Specific Access:**  The options listed here are assumed to be for administrative users, granting them elevated privileges compared to regular credit card holders.
* **Menu Organization:** The menu seems to group related functionalities, starting with account management, then moving to credit card operations, transaction handling, reporting, and finally bill payment.
* **User Interface Not Defined:**  This code focuses solely on the menu structure and the underlying program calls. The actual visual presentation of the menu is determined elsewhere in the application.
