##  Unveiling Account Data: A Look into the CBACT01C Program

**File:**  \CardDemo Application\Batch Programs\CBACT01C.cbl

This COBOL program is like a diligent accountant, meticulously reading and organizing credit card account information from a secure file.  Let's break down its actions in a way everyone can understand:

**Context:**

Imagine a big ledger where all credit card account details are meticulously stored. This program's primary job is to open that ledger, read each account's information one by one, and present it in an organized manner.

**Action:**

1. **Accessing the Ledger:** The program starts by opening the account data file, which is like opening the secure ledger.  It ensures the file is accessible and ready for reading.
2. **Reading Each Account:** It then reads the details of each account, including information like account ID, current balance, credit limit, and other important data points. 
3. **Displaying the Information:**  For every account it reads, the program neatly presents the information on the screen. Think of it as the program creating a summary report for each account in the ledger.
4. **Handling End of File:** The program knows when it reaches the last account in the file (like reaching the last page of the ledger). At this point, it closes the file securely.
5. **Error Management:**  Throughout the process, the program is on the lookout for any errors, such as the inability to open the file or read an account. If it encounters any issues, it flags them for attention.

**Business Rules:**

* **Sequential Processing:** The program processes accounts one after another in the order they appear in the file, ensuring all records are reviewed.
* **Data Integrity:**  The program emphasizes accurately reading and displaying data from the account file, which is crucial for maintaining reliable account information.
* **Error Reporting:**  By identifying and reporting errors, the program helps maintain the integrity of the account data and ensures any issues are addressed promptly.
