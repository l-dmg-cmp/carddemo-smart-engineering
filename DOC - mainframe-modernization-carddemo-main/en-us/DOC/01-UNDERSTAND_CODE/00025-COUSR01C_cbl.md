## Adding New Users to CardDemo: Behind the Scenes

**File:**  \CardDemo Application\Main Programs\COUSR01C.cbl

This code is the engine behind adding new users to the CardDemo system.  It makes sure all the required information is entered correctly and then safely stores it in the system's user database.

**Context:**

Imagine you're a CardDemo administrator, and you need to grant access to a new employee. You would use an interface (likely a simple screen) to enter the new user's details. This code springs into action when you hit "Enter" to submit that information.

**Action:**

1. **Data Validation:**  The code first checks if you've filled in all the mandatory fields like First Name, Last Name, User ID, Password, and User Type (Regular or Admin). If anything is missing, it politely points out the error and asks you to complete it.
2. **Security Check:** Once all fields are filled, it checks if the chosen User ID is already taken. If so, it alerts you to choose a different one. 
3. **Saving the User:** If everything looks good, the code securely stores the new user's information in the CardDemo user database (called USRSEC). It then confirms that the user has been successfully added.
4. **Clean Slate:** Finally, the code clears the input fields, ready for you to add another user if needed.

**Business Rules:**

* **Mandatory Fields:** The business requires all new user registrations to include First Name, Last Name, User ID, Password, and User Type to ensure data integrity and security.
* **Unique User ID:** Each user in the system must have a distinct User ID to avoid confusion and access issues.  The code enforces this by preventing the creation of duplicate usernames.
* **User Roles:** CardDemo differentiates between "Regular" and "Admin" users, likely with different levels of access and permissions within the system.  This distinction is captured during user creation.
