##  Updating User Information: A Look at the COUSR02C Program

**File:**  \src\COUSR02C.cbl

This COBOL program, named COUSR02C, is a critical part of the CardDemo application. Its primary function is to manage updates to user information stored within the system.  Think of it as the control center for modifying user details, ensuring accuracy and security throughout the process.

**Context:**

Imagine this scenario: an administrator needs to update an existing user's information, perhaps their last name, password, or user role.  They would navigate to the user update screen, input the necessary changes, and hit 'save.' Behind the scenes, the COUSR02C program springs into action, orchestrating the entire update procedure.

**Action:**

1. **Input Gathering:** The program first captures all the data entered by the administrator on the user update screen, including user ID, first name, last name, password, and user type.
2. **Data Validation:** Before any changes are made, the program meticulously checks the entered information. Are all mandatory fields filled?  Are the password and user ID formats correct? This step acts as a gatekeeper, preventing inaccurate or incomplete data from entering the system.
3. **User Lookup:** The program then searches for the user's record in the system's database (USRSEC file) using the entered user ID. This step ensures that the program is updating the correct user's information.
4. **Data Comparison:** Once the user's record is found, the program compares the entered information with the existing data.  This step identifies what information has been modified by the administrator.
5. **Update Execution:**  If changes are detected, the program updates the user's record in the database with the new information. If no changes are found, the program informs the administrator and doesn't modify the record.
6. **Confirmation Message:** After a successful update, the administrator receives a confirmation message, assuring them that the changes have been saved. If any errors occur during the process, the program displays an appropriate error message, guiding the administrator to rectify the issue.

**Business Rules:**

* **Data Integrity:** The program prioritizes the accuracy of user information.  Mandatory fields and data format validations ensure that only valid and complete information is stored in the system.
* **Security:**  The program plays a role in maintaining the system's security. By requiring administrators to re-enter the password, it reduces the risk of accidental changes to sensitive information. 
* **User Experience:** The program is designed to provide a user-friendly experience for administrators. Clear error messages and confirmation notifications keep them informed throughout the update process. 
* **Audit Trail:** While not explicitly stated, it is implied that the system should maintain an audit trail of user information changes for security and accountability purposes. This trail might include who made the changes, what was changed, and when it was changed.
