##  Customer Data Structure: The Heart of Customer Information

**File:** CUSTREC.cpy

**Context:**

This code defines how customer information is organized and stored within the CardDemo application. Think of it as the blueprint for a customer's record.

**Action:**

* **Structure:** The code defines a structure called `CUSTOMER-RECORD`, which acts as a container for various pieces of customer information.
* **Fields:** Inside this container, there are individual fields like `CUST-ID`, `CUST-FIRST-NAME`, `CUST-LAST-NAME`, `CUST-ADDR-LINE-1` (address), etc. Each field holds a specific piece of information about the customer.
* **Data Types:**  Each field is assigned a data type, like `PIC 9(09)` for numeric data (e.g., Customer ID) and `PIC X(25)` for text data (e.g., First Name, Last Name). This ensures data consistency and accuracy.

**Business Rules:**

* **Customer Identification:** `CUST-ID` likely serves as a unique identifier for each customer in the system.
* **Contact Information:**  Fields like `CUST-PHONE-NUM-1`, `CUST-PHONE-NUM-2`, and email addresses (not shown in this excerpt) are crucial for reaching out to customers.
* **Address Management:**  The code provisions for storing multiple lines of address information, along with state, country, and ZIP code, ensuring accurate customer location details.
* **Financial Data:**  Fields like `CUST-EFT-ACCOUNT-ID` suggest the system's capability to handle electronic funds transfers, likely for payments or other financial transactions.
* **Creditworthiness:** `CUST-FICO-CREDIT-SCORE` is a strong indicator of a customer's credit history and financial reliability, essential for credit card applications and limit management.
