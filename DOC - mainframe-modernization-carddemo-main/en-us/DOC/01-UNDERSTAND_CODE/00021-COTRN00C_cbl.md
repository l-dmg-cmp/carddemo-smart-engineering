## Transaction Listing: Viewing Your Credit Card Activity

**File:**  \src\COTRN00C.cbl

**Context:**

This code powers the transaction listing functionality within the CardDemo application, a system used for managing credit card operations. Think of it as the part of the application that lets you view a history of your credit card transactions, much like you would see on a bank statement.

**Action:**

1. **Requesting Transaction Data:** The code starts by fetching transaction records from a database-like system called VSAM. It retrieves these records in batches (or pages), allowing you to navigate through your transaction history.

2. **Displaying Transactions:**  The retrieved transactions are then neatly organized and displayed on the screen.  Each transaction entry typically includes details such as:
    - Transaction ID: A unique identifier for each transaction.
    - Date: The date the transaction took place.
    - Description:  A brief summary of the transaction (e.g., "Grocery Store Purchase").
    - Amount: The monetary value of the transaction.

3. **Navigation and Filtering:** To help you find specific transactions, the code provides several navigation options:
    - Page Up/Page Down:  Allows you to move back and forth between pages of transactions.
    - Transaction Selection: While not fully implemented in the provided code, there's a provision for selecting a specific transaction, likely for viewing more detailed information.

4. **Error Handling:** The code is designed to handle potential issues gracefully.  For instance, if you reach the end of your transaction history or try to navigate past the first or last page, it will display appropriate messages, preventing any confusion.

**Business Rules:**

* **Transaction History Retrieval:** The system must securely access and retrieve transaction records associated with a specific user's account, ensuring data privacy and accuracy. 
* **Pagination:**  Transactions should be displayed in manageable chunks (pages) to avoid overwhelming the user with potentially large amounts of data.
* **Clear Navigation:** The user interface should provide intuitive options for navigating through transaction history, allowing them to easily move between pages or select specific transactions for further details.
* **User-Friendly Messages:** In case of errors or reaching the end of available data, the system should display clear and informative messages to guide the user.
