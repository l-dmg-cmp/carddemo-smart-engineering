##  Transaction Type Mapping: A Simple Guide

**File:**  trantype.txt

**Context:**

This file acts like a dictionary for understanding transaction codes.  Instead of seeing cryptic numbers like "01" or "05" on a statement, this file helps translate those codes into plain language, making it clear whether a transaction was a purchase, a payment, or something else.

**Action:**

1. **Lookup Table:**  The file presents a simple two-column structure. 
    * The left column contains a numerical code – likely representing a specific type of transaction.
    * The right column provides a short, descriptive text corresponding to that code.

2. **Example:**
    * `01 Purchase`:  This tells us that whenever the code "01" appears, it signifies a purchase transaction.
    * `05 Refund`:  Similarly, the code "05" would indicate a refund.

**Business Rules:**

* **Standardized Codes:** The use of numerical codes suggests a system for categorizing and tracking different transaction types, crucial for accurate record-keeping and analysis.
* **User-Friendly Descriptions:**  By associating plain-language descriptions with each code, the system aims to provide clarity to anyone reviewing transaction information – be it a customer, an analyst, or a customer service representative.
