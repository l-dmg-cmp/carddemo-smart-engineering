## Account View Functionality: Displaying Credit Card Account Details

**File:**  \COACTVWC.cbl

This COBOL program defines the "Account View" functionality within a larger credit card management system. It retrieves and displays detailed information about a specific credit card account based on the account number provided.

**Context:**

Imagine a customer service representative is on the phone with a customer inquiring about their credit card account. The representative needs to access the account details to answer questions about balances, credit limits, and other relevant information. This program provides that functionality.

**Action:**

1. **Input:** The program receives a credit card account number as input, either entered manually or passed from another program within the system.
2. **Data Retrieval:**  It then accesses various data files to retrieve the necessary information. First, it checks a "cross-reference" file (CARDXREF) to find the corresponding customer ID associated with the account number. Using the customer ID, it retrieves customer data (CUSTDAT) like name, address, and contact information. Finally, it uses the account number to access detailed account information (ACCTDAT) such as balance, credit limit, and transaction history. 
3. **Display:** The retrieved data is then formatted and displayed on the screen in an organized manner. This may include:
    - Account Status (Active, Closed, etc.)
    - Current Balance
    - Credit Limit
    - Available Credit
    - Customer Information (Name, Address, etc.)
    - Other relevant account details
4. **Navigation:** The program also handles user interaction, allowing the representative to navigate to other related functions within the system, such as viewing transaction history or updating account information.

**Business Rules:**

* **Account Number Validation:** The program includes validation checks to ensure the entered account number is valid and exists within the system.
* **Data Integrity:** Data retrieval from multiple files (CARDXREF, CUSTDAT, ACCTDAT) ensures the displayed information is accurate and up-to-date.
* **Security and Access Control:** While not explicitly mentioned, it's crucial to highlight that access to this sensitive financial information should be restricted to authorized personnel only. This is typically handled through system-level security measures and user authentication protocols. 
* **User-Friendly Interface:** The program aims to present the information clearly and concisely, allowing for efficient retrieval and review of account details.
