##  Mapping User Actions to Program Functions in a CICS Application

**File:**  \CSSTRPFY.cpy

This code snippet acts as a translator between user actions on a terminal and specific functions within a CICS application. Think of it as a way to understand what the user wants to do when they press a key on their keyboard.

**Context:**

This code would be used in a CICS application, likely running on an IBM mainframe. Imagine a user interacting with a text-based screen to manage data, such as viewing account information or processing transactions.  They use keys like "Enter," function keys (F1, F2, etc.), and potentially light pens or other terminal-specific input methods.

**Action:**

1. **Capture User Action (AID):** The code starts by identifying the specific action the user took on their terminal.  This action is represented by an "Attention Identifier" or AID.  For example, pressing the "Enter" key generates a specific AID, as does pressing F1, and so on.
2. **Translate AID to Program Function:** The code then uses a series of comparisons (the `EVALUATE TRUE` and `WHEN` statements) to match the detected AID to a corresponding program function.  It's essentially a lookup table: if the user pressed F1, set a flag indicating they want to perform function "PFK01," if they pressed F2, set the flag for "PFK02," and so on.
3. **Store User Intent:**  Instead of directly executing the function, the code sets flags (e.g., `CCARD-AID-PFK01`, `CCARD-AID-PFK02`) in a common area.  This allows other parts of the CICS application to understand what the user intends to do.

**Business Rules:**

* **User Interface Consistency:** This code ensures that regardless of the specific terminal the user is on, their actions (key presses) are consistently translated into meaningful program functions.  This is crucial for usability, especially in environments where users might work with different terminal types.
* **Flexibility and Maintainability:**  By mapping AIDs to flags rather than directly calling functions, the application gains flexibility.  The logic for handling specific functions can be changed or updated without modifying this mapping code, making maintenance easier.
* **State Management:** The use of flags in a common area implies a way to manage the state of the application.  Knowing what the user wants to do allows other parts of the application to respond accordingly, potentially guiding the user through a workflow or presenting relevant information based on their intended action.
