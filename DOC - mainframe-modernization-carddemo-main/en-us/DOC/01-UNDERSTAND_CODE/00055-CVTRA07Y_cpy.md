##  Breaking Down the Transaction Report Data Structure

**File:**  \CVTRA07Y.cpy

This code defines the layout of a transaction report, similar to a blueprint that dictates how transaction information should be organized and presented. 

**Context:**

Imagine you're a business owner reviewing a summary of all daily transactions.  This code ensures that information like transaction ID, account details, transaction type, and the amount is displayed in a clear and organized manner.

**Action:**

1. **Report Header:** The code starts by defining the header section of the report, which includes:
    *  **Report Titles:**  Displays titles like "Daily Transaction Report".
    *  **Date Range:** Shows the start and end dates for the transactions included in the report.
2. **Transaction Details:** This section outlines the structure for each transaction record within the report, specifying:
    *  **Data Fields:** Defines individual pieces of information for each transaction, such as Transaction ID, Account ID, Transaction Type Code and Description, Category Code and Description, Transaction Source, and Amount.
    *  **Formatting:** Dictates how each data field should be presented, like aligning amounts to the right for better readability.
3. **Headers and Totals:** The code further defines:
    * **Column Headers:** Provides clear labels for each column in the transaction details section.
    * **Total Lines:**  Calculates and presents subtotals for each page, account, and a grand total for the entire report.

**Business Rules:**

* **Clear Organization:** The code ensures that transaction data is presented in a structured format, making it easy to read and understand.
* **Informative Headers:** By defining headers for each section and column, the code enhances the report's clarity.
* **Meaningful Totals:**  Calculating and displaying totals at various levels (page, account, grand) provide a comprehensive overview of the transaction data.
* **Standardized Format:** This structured layout allows for easy comparison of transactions and facilitates efficient data analysis for business decisions.
