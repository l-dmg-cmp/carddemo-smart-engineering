##  User Management in CardDemo Application: Navigating the User List

**File:**  \src\COUSR00C.cbl

This COBOL program, COUSR00C.cbl, is the engine behind the user list functionality within the CardDemo application. It's responsible for retrieving user information from a secure file and presenting it to authorized personnel in a clear, organized manner. 

**Context:**

Imagine you're an administrator for the CardDemo system. You need to manage user accounts, which includes viewing existing users, their details, and potentially updating or removing them. This code handles the display of users in a paginated list, allowing you to navigate through the records and select specific users for further actions.

**Action:**

1. **Initial Display:** Upon accessing the user list, the program retrieves an initial set of user records from the secure USRSEC file. This file likely contains details such as user ID, name, and user type.
2. **Pagination:** Since there might be many users, the program presents the information in manageable pages. You can navigate between these pages using function keys (PF7 for previous page, PF8 for next page) to browse through all user records.
3. **User Selection:** Each user in the list is presented with options for update (U) or delete (D) actions.  Selecting one of these options flags the specific user and prepares the system for the next step.
4. **Action Handoff:** Depending on whether you chose to update (U) or delete (D), the program seamlessly transfers control to a dedicated program designed for that specific action (COUSR02C for update, COUSR03C for delete).

**Business Rules:**

* **Security:** The program interacts with a secure user file (USRSEC) implying that access to this functionality is restricted to authorized personnel with appropriate privileges. 
* **User-Friendly Navigation:** The program incorporates pagination to handle potentially large numbers of user records, making it easier for administrators to locate specific users.
* **Streamlined Workflow:** By using a dedicated program for each user action (update/delete), the system ensures a clear and efficient workflow for user management tasks.
