## Understanding Credit Card Data Structure in COBOL

**File:** \COCRDSL.CPY

**Context:**

This code defines how credit card information is organized and stored within a system, much like a digital blueprint for a credit card record. It's essential for ensuring that the system can accurately process and display card details.

**Action:**

1. **Structure:** The code defines two data structures: `CCRDSLAI` and `CCRDSLAO`.  Think of these as containers holding various pieces of information about a credit card. 
2. **Data Fields:** Each container has compartments (data fields) for specific details like:
    * `TRNNAME`:  Transaction name
    * `TITLE01`, `TITLE02`:  Headings or labels for display 
    * `CURDATE`, `CURTIME`: Current date and time
    * `PGMNAME`:  Program name 
    * `ACCTSID`, `CARDSID`:  Account and card identifiers
    * `CRDNAME`: Cardholder's name
    * `CRDSTCD`: Credit card type code
    * `EXPMON`, `EXPYEAR`:  Card expiry month and year
    * `INFOMSG`, `ERRMSG`:  Messages to provide information or errors
    * `FKEYS`:  Function keys (likely for user interaction)
3. **Display Attributes:** The `CCRDSLAO` structure seems specifically designed for presenting this information on a screen, potentially with color coding.  It includes fields like `C`, `P`, `H`, `V`, `O` which might represent different display attributes (color, highlighting, etc.).

**Business Rules:**

* **Standardized Data:**  By defining a strict structure, the system ensures all credit card information is stored uniformly, making it easier to process and manage.
* **Data Integrity:** The specific data types and lengths (e.g., `PIC X(16)` for a 16-character card number) help maintain data accuracy and prevent errors.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** The inclusion of display attributes suggests an effort to present the information clearly and intuitively to users, potentially on a terminal or screen-based interface.
