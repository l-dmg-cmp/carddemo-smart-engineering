##  Displaying Titles on the Credit Card Demo Application

**File:**  COTTL01Y.cpy

**Context:**

This code defines the titles and messages that a user would see while using the Credit Card Demo Application (CCDA).  Think of it as setting the stage and creating a welcoming atmosphere for the user.

**Action:**

1. **Title Lines:** The code sets up two lines of text to be displayed prominently, likely at the top of the screen. 
   - The first line proudly announces "AWS Mainframe Modernization," highlighting that this application is part of a modern approach to mainframe systems.
   -  The second line more specifically identifies the application as the "Credit Card Demo Application (CCDA)."  It also includes the shorter name "CardDemo," which might be used in other parts of the application.
2. **Thank You Message:**  The code also prepares a polite "Thank You" message that would appear when the user is exiting the application. This contributes to a positive user experience by acknowledging the user's interaction.

**Business Rules:**

* **Branding:** The titles clearly associate the application with AWS Mainframe Modernization, emphasizing its connection to modern technology and potentially increasing user confidence.
* **Clarity:** By providing both the full application name and a shortened version, the code ensures clear communication and avoids confusion for the user.
* **User Experience:** The inclusion of a "Thank You" message adds a touch of personalization and courtesy, making the application feel more user-friendly.
