##  Card Data File Processing: A Look Inside

**File:**  \src\CBACT02C.cbl

**Context:**

This program is a key part of the CardDemo application, responsible for reading and displaying the information stored in the credit card data file. Think of it as opening a spreadsheet with all your credit card details and printing its contents.

**Action:**

1. **File Access:** The program starts by opening the credit card data file. It expects the file to be structured in a specific way (VSAM KSDS) to locate information quickly.
2. **Data Reading:** Once the file is open, the program reads each credit card record one by one.
3. **Display:**  For each record read, the program displays the credit card information. This could be sending the data to a printer or showing it on a screen.
4. **Error Handling:** If there's any issue accessing or reading the file, the program flags an error, displays a message, and stops further processing.
5. **File Closing:** After processing all records or encountering an error, the program closes the credit card data file to avoid any data corruption.

**Business Rules:**

* **Sequential Processing:** The program reads and displays credit card records one after the other in the order they are stored in the file.
* **Error Reporting:** Any issues encountered while accessing or reading the credit card data file are reported with specific error messages, allowing for investigation and resolution.
* **Data Integrity:** The program ensures data integrity by properly opening and closing the credit card file, preventing potential data loss or corruption.
