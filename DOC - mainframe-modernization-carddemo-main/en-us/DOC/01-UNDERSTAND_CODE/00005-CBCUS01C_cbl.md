## Decoding the Customer Data File Processor (CBCUS01C)

**File:**  \src\CBCUS01C.cbl

This program reads and displays customer data from a file named `CUSTFILE`. Think of it like going through a file cabinet, opening each customer folder, and then showing the information on the computer screen.

**Context:**

In the CardDemo application, we need a way to access and display customer information. This program handles that task. 

**Action:**

1. **Open the File Cabinet:** The program starts by opening the `CUSTFILE` where customer data is stored. 
2. **Read Customer Information:** It then reads the information of each customer, one by one.
3. **Show the Information:**  For each customer, the program displays their details on the screen. 
4. **Close the File Cabinet:** Once all customer information has been processed, the program closes the `CUSTFILE`.

**Business Rules:**

* **Customer Data:** This program accesses and displays sensitive customer data, ensuring that this information is handled carefully and securely.
* **Sequential Processing:** The program processes customer data sequentially, meaning it reads and displays information one customer after another in the order they are stored in the file.
* **Error Handling:** The program includes checks for potential errors during file operations (opening, reading, closing) and displays messages if any issues occur. This ensures data integrity and system stability.
