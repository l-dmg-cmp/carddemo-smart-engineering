## Adding New Transactions: A Look at the COTRN02C Program

**File:** `\src\COTRN02C.cbl`

This code handles the addition of new transactions to the CardDemo application.  It ensures that the information entered by the user is accurate and complete before recording the transaction.

**Context:**

Think of this code as the digital form you fill out when making a purchase with your credit card. It captures all the essential details of the transaction, like the date, amount, merchant, and your card information.

**Action:**

1. **Data Entry:** The user enters transaction details (transaction type, category, amount, merchant details, etc.) on a screen.
2. **Input Validation:**  The code checks if the entered information follows specific rules:
    - **Are the account and card numbers valid?** - It verifies this by cross-referencing with account and card data.
    - **Is the transaction amount in the correct format?** 
    - **Are the dates entered correctly?**
    - **Are all mandatory fields filled?** 
3. **Transaction Recording:** If all the information is correct, the code generates a unique transaction ID and saves the transaction details to the TRANSACT file. It confirms the successful addition of the transaction to the user.
4. **Error Handling:** If any information is incorrect or missing, the code highlights the error and guides the user to correct it.

**Business Rules:**

* **Data Integrity:**  The code enforces data accuracy by validating user input against predefined formats and rules, ensuring the reliability of transaction records.
* **Transaction Uniqueness:** Each transaction is assigned a unique ID, preventing duplication and ensuring each transaction is traceable.
* **Mandatory Data:** The code requires specific fields to be filled, guaranteeing that all essential transaction information is captured. 
* **Real-time Validation:** Validation happens as the user enters information, providing immediate feedback and a smoother user experience.
* **Auditability:** By recording transaction details and timestamps, the system maintains an auditable history of all transactions.
