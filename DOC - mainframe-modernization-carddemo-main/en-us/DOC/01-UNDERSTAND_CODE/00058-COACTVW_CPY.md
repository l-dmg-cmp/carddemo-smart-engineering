##  Understanding Account View Data: A Glimpse into Customer Accounts

**File:**  \src\COACTVW.CPY

This code defines how account information is structured for viewing by the system or potentially a user.  It acts as a template to ensure consistency when handling account data, much like a standardized form for recording customer details.

**Context:**

Imagine this code as the blueprint for a customer's account snapshot.  Whenever the system needs to display or process account information, it refers to this template to understand what data is available and how it's organized.

**Action:**

1.  **Data Organization (CACTVWAI):** The code first defines a structure called "CACTVWAI."  This structure is like a container holding various pieces of information about an account, such as:
    *   Account ID: A unique number identifying the account.
    *   Account Status: Whether the account is active, closed, etc.
    *   Balances and Limits: Current balance, credit limit, and available credit.
    *   Customer Details:  Name, address, phone number, and other identifying information.
    *   Messages:  Any informational or error messages related to the account.

2.  **Data Formatting for Display (CACTVWAO):**  The code then defines a second structure called "CACTVWAO."  This structure mirrors the information in "CACTVWAI" but focuses on presenting it in a user-friendly format.  For instance:
    *   Numeric values like balances and limits are formatted with commas and decimal points.
    *   Fields are arranged for potential display on a screen or report.

**Business Rules:**

*   **Standardized Account Information:** The code ensures that all parts of the system use the same structure and format when working with account data, promoting consistency and accuracy.
*   **Clear Data Presentation:** The "CACTVWAO" structure focuses on presenting account data clearly, making it easier for users or other systems to understand.
*   **Comprehensive Account Snapshot:** The code includes a wide range of account-related information, providing a comprehensive view for various business processes.
