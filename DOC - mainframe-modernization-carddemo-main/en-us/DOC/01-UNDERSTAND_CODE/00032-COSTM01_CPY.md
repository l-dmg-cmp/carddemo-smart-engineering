##  Deciphering the Transaction Blueprint: A Look into CardDemo's Reporting Structure

**File:**  \COSTM01.CPY

**Context:**

This code snippet acts as a blueprint for how credit/debit card transaction details are organized, particularly when generating reports within the CardDemo system. Think of it as a template that ensures consistency and clarity when presenting transaction information.

**Action:**

1. **Defining the Structure (TRNX-RECORD):** The code establishes a structure named "TRNX-RECORD," which acts as a container for all the essential details of a single transaction.
2. **Key Identification (TRNX-KEY):** Within this container, a section called "TRNX-KEY" is dedicated to uniquely identifying each transaction.  It includes:
    * **TRNX-CARD-NUM:** The credit/debit card number associated with the transaction (up to 16 digits).
    * **TRNX-ID:** A unique identifier for the transaction itself (up to 16 characters).
3. **Transaction Particulars (TRNX-REST):** This section houses the core details of the transaction:
    * **TRNX-TYPE-CD:**  A two-character code signifying the type of transaction (e.g., purchase, refund, withdrawal).
    * **TRNX-CAT-CD:** A four-digit code categorizing the transaction (e.g., groceries, travel, entertainment).
    * **TRNX-SOURCE:**  Indicates where the transaction originated (e.g., online, POS terminal, ATM) (up to 10 characters).
    * **TRNX-DESC:**  A brief description of the transaction (up to 100 characters).
    * **TRNX-AMT:** The transaction amount, including two decimal places for cents.
    * **TRNX-MERCHANT-ID:** A unique identifier for the merchant involved (up to 9 digits).
    * **TRNX-MERCHANT-NAME:**  The name of the merchant (up to 50 characters).
    * **TRNX-MERCHANT-CITY:** The city of the merchant's location (up to 50 characters).
    * **TRNX-MERCHANT-ZIP:** The ZIP code of the merchant's location (up to 10 characters).
    * **TRNX-ORIG-TS:** The date and time when the transaction was initiated (up to 26 characters).
    * **TRNX-PROC-TS:** The date and time when the transaction was processed (up to 26 characters).
4. **Ensuring Alignment (FILLER):**  This acts as a placeholder, ensuring that the data is aligned correctly for processing and reporting.

**Business Rules:**

* **Standardized Reporting:** The defined structure ("TRNX-RECORD") acts as a standard format for all transaction reports within the CardDemo system, ensuring consistency and ease of data interpretation.
* **Transaction Identification:** The "TRNX-KEY" section enables quick and accurate retrieval of specific transactions using either the card number or a unique transaction ID.
* **Detailed Transaction Information:** The "TRNX-REST" section provides a comprehensive overview of each transaction, including its type, category, amount, involved parties (merchant), and timestamps.
* **Merchant Identification:** The inclusion of merchant details like ID, name, city, and ZIP code facilitates tracking and analyzing transactions by specific merchants or geographical locations. 
* **Chronological Tracking:** The transaction timestamps ("TRNX-ORIG-TS" and "TRNX-PROC-TS") enable tracking transaction flow and identifying potential delays in processing.
