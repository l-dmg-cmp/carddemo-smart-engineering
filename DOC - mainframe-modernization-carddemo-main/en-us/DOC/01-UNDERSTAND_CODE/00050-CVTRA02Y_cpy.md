##  Deciphering the Disclosure Group Structure: Understanding Financial Data Organization

**File:**  \CVTRA02Y.cpy

This code defines how financial information, specifically related to "disclosure groups," is organized within the system. Imagine this structure as a blueprint for a container that holds crucial details about interest rates and transaction categories.

**Context:**

In the realm of financial systems, it's essential to categorize transactions and apply specific interest rates based on their nature. This code snippet lays the groundwork for such categorization, ensuring that each transaction is associated with the correct interest calculation.

**Action:**

1. **Structure Definition:** The code establishes a structured format named "DIS-GROUP-RECORD" to store information about a disclosure group.
2. **Key Identification:** Within this structure, it defines a "DIS-GROUP-KEY" to uniquely identify each group. This key comprises:
    - **DIS-ACCT-GROUP-ID:** A 10-character code representing the account group.
    - **DIS-TRAN-TYPE-CD:** A 2-character code signifying the transaction type (e.g., purchase, withdrawal).
    - **DIS-TRAN-CAT-CD:** A 4-digit numeric code for the transaction category (e.g., groceries, travel).
3. **Interest Rate Association:** The "DIS-INT-RATE" field stores the interest rate linked to this specific disclosure group. This rate would be applied to transactions falling under this group's criteria.

**Business Rules:**

* **Transaction Categorization:**  The code enforces a system for categorizing transactions based on account group, type, and category, ensuring accurate interest calculations.
* **Interest Rate Differentiation:** By linking a specific interest rate to each disclosure group, the code enables the application of different rates based on transaction characteristics.
* **Data Integrity:** The structured format ensures that information is stored consistently, maintaining data integrity and reliability for reporting and analysis.
