##  Transaction Report Generation: A Behind-the-Scenes Look

**File:**  \src\CORPT00C.cbl

This COBOL program, `CORPT00C`, is the engine behind generating transaction reports in the CardDemo application. It allows users to initiate the creation of reports for different periods. Think of it as the online portal to order a customized report about credit card transactions.

**Context:**

Imagine a business user who needs a summarized report of all credit card transactions, maybe for the last month or even the entire year.  They don't want to dig through a database manually. Instead, they log into the CardDemo system, and that's where this program comes in.

**Action:**

1. **User Input:** The program presents the user with options to choose the type of report they need: Monthly, Yearly, or a Custom date range. 
2. **Data Validation:** It carefully checks if the dates entered by the user are logical and in the correct format. No one wants a report that starts in the future!
3. **Report Request Preparation:**  Behind the scenes, the program prepares a set of instructions (like a recipe) for another program that will actually generate the report. This "recipe" is tailored based on the user's selections.
4. **Request Submission:** The program then securely submits the request to a queue where it waits to be picked up and processed by the report generation program.
5. **Confirmation:**  Finally, the user receives a confirmation message on their screen, letting them know their report request has been successfully submitted. 

**Business Rules:**

* **Report Types:** The program offers flexibility by allowing users to generate reports based on predefined periods (monthly, yearly) or a custom date range.
* **Data Integrity:** The built-in validation ensures that the reports are generated for valid date ranges, preventing errors or nonsensical results.
* **Asynchronous Processing:** By submitting the report request to a queue, the program doesn't keep the user waiting while the report is being generated, which could take time for large datasets.
* **User Feedback:** The confirmation message provides transparency to the user, assuring them that their request is being handled.
