##  Unpacking the Abend Data Structure:  Understanding System Errors

**File:**  \CSMSG02Y.cpy

This code defines a blueprint (a data structure) specifically for holding information about errors that cause a program to stop working correctly. Think of it like a standardized form for recording system malfunctions.

**Context:**

Let's imagine our system encounters a critical issue during a credit card transaction, like a network outage or an invalid account number.  The system needs a way to recognize this problem, stop processing to prevent further issues, and log the details of what happened. That's where this code comes in.

**Action:**

This code doesn't actively "do" something like processing a transaction or updating a database. Instead, it acts as a container, defining the format for storing information when something goes wrong.  This "container" has compartments for:

* **ABEND-CODE:** A specific code that acts as a shorthand for the type of error encountered (e.g., "Network Error," "Invalid Input").
* **ABEND-CULPRIT:**  The name of the program or part of the system where the error originated, helping developers pinpoint the source of the issue.
* **ABEND-REASON:**  A more detailed explanation of why the error occurred, providing context for debugging. 
* **ABEND-MSG:** A general message about the error, which might be displayed to a system administrator or used for logging purposes. 

**Business Rules:**

* **Error Tracking:** By capturing the abend code, culprit, reason, and a general message, the system can keep a detailed record of errors, crucial for identifying recurring issues.
* **Problem Resolution:**  This structured information helps technical teams quickly understand what went wrong, where it happened, and why, making it easier to fix problems.
* **System Stability:** By halting processing when a serious error occurs, this structure contributes to the overall stability of the system, preventing potentially corrupted data or cascading failures.
