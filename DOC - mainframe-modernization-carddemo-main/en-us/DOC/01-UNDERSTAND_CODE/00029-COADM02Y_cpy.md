##  CardDemo Admin Menu: Managing User Access and Security

**File:**  \COADM02Y.cpy

**Context:**

This code defines the administrative menu options specifically related to user management within the CardDemo application. This is a crucial aspect of any system, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access sensitive information and perform specific actions.

**Action:**

1. **Structure:** The code utilizes a structured data format common in COBOL, where data is organized into hierarchical levels.
2. **Menu Options:**  It defines four key options for managing users:
    - **User List (Security):**  Allows administrators to view a list of all registered users.
    - **User Add (Security):** Enables the creation of new user accounts.
    - **User Update (Security):**  Facilitates the modification of existing user details or permissions.
    - **User Delete (Security):**  Provides a way to remove user accounts from the system. 
3. **Program Association:**  Each menu option is linked to a specific COBOL program (e.g., COUSR00C for User List) responsible for executing the chosen action. This modular approach enhances code organization and maintainability.
4. **Data Storage:** While not explicitly stated, the user information, including usernames, passwords, and access levels, are likely stored in a VSAM file, a common data storage mechanism for mainframe systems.

**Business Rules:**

* **Access Control:** The administrative menu ensures that only authorized personnel (administrators) can manage user accounts, preventing unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
* **User Management:**  The provided options allow administrators to maintain a current and accurate user database, crucial for security audits and system integrity.
* **Security by Design:** By explicitly labeling these options as "Security" related, the code emphasizes the sensitive nature of user management and highlights the importance of adhering to strict security protocols.
