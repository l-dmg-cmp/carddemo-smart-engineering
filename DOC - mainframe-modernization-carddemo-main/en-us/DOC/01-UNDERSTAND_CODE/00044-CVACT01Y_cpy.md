##  Understanding Account Information in CardDemo

**File:**  \CVACT01Y.cpy

This code defines the way account information is organized and stored within the CardDemo system. Think of it as a digital template for an account record.

**Context:**

In any system managing financial accounts, having a structured way to store account details is crucial. This code snippet defines the "Account Record" â€“ a blueprint for holding all the essential information about each customer's account within the CardDemo application.

**Action:**

This code doesn't actively "do" anything in terms of calculations or actions. Instead, it acts as a blueprint. Imagine a table with labeled columns:

| Field Name                 | Description                                     | Example                  |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| ACCT-ID                    | Unique identifier for each account             | 12345678901             |
| ACCT-ACTIVE-STATUS         | Indicates if the account is active (e.g., 'Y'/'N') | 'Y'                     |
| ACCT-CURR-BAL              | Current account balance                         | 1500.50                 |
| ACCT-CREDIT-LIMIT          | Maximum credit allowed on the account          | 5000.00                 |
| ACCT-CASH-CREDIT-LIMIT     | Maximum cash withdrawal limit                 | 1000.00                 |
| ACCT-OPEN-DATE             | Date when the account was opened               | 2023-01-15              |
| ACCT-EXPIRAION-DATE        | Account expiration date                       | 2026-01-15              |
| ACCT-REISSUE-DATE          | Date the account was last renewed             | 2025-01-15              |
| ACCT-CURR-CYC-CREDIT       | Total credits in the current cycle          | 2000.00                 |
| ACCT-CURR-CYC-DEBIT        | Total debits in the current cycle            | 500.50                  |
| ACCT-ADDR-ZIP              | ZIP code associated with the account           | "90210"                 |
| ACCT-GROUP-ID              | Group affiliation of the account (if any)     | "PREMIUM"                |
| FILLER                     | Space reserved for future use                  | (Empty)                 |

**Business Rules:**

* **Unique Identification:** Each account is identified by a unique 'ACCT-ID,' ensuring that transactions are applied to the correct account.
* **Account Status:** The 'ACCT-ACTIVE-STATUS' field is crucial for managing account access and operations, ensuring that only active accounts are used.
* **Credit Management:** Fields like 'ACCT-CREDIT-LIMIT' and 'ACCT-CASH-CREDIT-LIMIT' are essential for managing risk and controlling credit utilization.
* **Account History:** Dates like 'ACCT-OPEN-DATE' and 'ACCT-REISSUE-DATE' help track the account's lifecycle and are essential for reporting.
* **Transaction Tracking:**  'ACCT-CURR-CYC-CREDIT' and 'ACCT-CURR-CYC-DEBIT' provide a snapshot of the account's activity within a specific cycle.
