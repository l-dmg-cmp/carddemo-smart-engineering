##  Deciphering the Credit Card Blueprint:  A Look at Data Organization

**File:**  \CVACT02Y.cpy

**Context:**

Imagine a behind-the-scenes peek into how a system stores credit card information. This code snippet defines the structure – think of it like a digital template or blueprint – for holding all the essential details about a credit card.

**Action:**

1. **Blueprint Creation:** The code establishes a structured format named "CARD-RECORD" to represent a credit card's data consistently.
2. **Data Compartments:** Within this blueprint, it creates individual compartments or fields for storing specific pieces of information:
    - **CARD-NUM:** Holds the actual credit card number.
    - **CARD-ACCT-ID:** Stores a unique identifier linking the card to a specific account.
    - **CARD-CVV-CD:**  Contains the card verification value (CVV), a security code typically found on the back of the card.
    - **CARD-EMBOSSED-NAME:**  Stores the name of the cardholder as it appears on the physical card.
    - **CARD-EXPIRAION-DATE:** Holds the date when the card is no longer valid.
    - **CARD-ACTIVE-STATUS:** Indicates whether the card is currently active and usable.
3. **Space Allocation:** Each compartment is assigned a specific space, ensuring data is stored uniformly, much like designated boxes for organizing items.

**Business Rules:**

* **Data Integrity:** By defining a strict structure, the code ensures that credit card information is stored consistently and accurately.
* **Security:** The inclusion of fields like CVV highlights the importance of security in handling sensitive card details.
* **Account Linking:** The `CARD-ACCT-ID`  field emphasizes the relationship between a card and its corresponding account, enabling transactions and operations to be linked correctly.
* **Card Lifecycle Management:** The `CARD-EXPIRAION-DATE` and `CARD-ACTIVE-STATUS` fields facilitate the management of card validity and usage over time.
