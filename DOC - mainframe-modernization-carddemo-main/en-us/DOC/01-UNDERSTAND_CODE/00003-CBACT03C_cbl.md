## Card Account Cross-Reference Data File Processor - CBACT03C

**File:**  `\src\CBACT03C.cbl`

**Context:**

This program is like a specialized search tool for credit card account information within the larger CardDemo application. It's designed to run in the background, not directly interacted with by users. Think of it as a tool for internal reporting or data analysis.

**Action:**

1. **File Access:** The program starts by locating and opening a specific file containing cross-referenced card account data. This file is organized like a well-structured directory for quick data retrieval.
2. **Data Reading:** It then reads each record (like individual entries) from this file one by one.
3. **Information Display:**  For each record read, the program displays the information contained within it.  This could be for basic reporting purposes or to verify data integrity.
4. **Error Handling:** Throughout the process, the program diligently checks for any issues, such as problems accessing the file or reaching the end of the data. If errors occur, it stops and provides helpful messages to identify the problem.

**Business Rules:**

* **Data Integrity:** The program assumes the cross-reference data file exists and is structured correctly. Any discrepancies in this file would disrupt its operation.
* **Sequential Processing:** The program processes records one after another in the order they are stored. This implies a specific organization of data within the file.
* **Error Reporting:** The program prioritizes identifying and reporting any issues encountered during its execution, crucial for maintaining data accuracy and system stability.
