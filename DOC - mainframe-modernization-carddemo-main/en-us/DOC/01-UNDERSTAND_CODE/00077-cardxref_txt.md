##  Card Cross-Reference Insights: Understanding the Data

**File:**  cardxref.txt

**Context:**

This file acts like a simplified index card for our credit card system.  Think of a library's card catalog - it helps us quickly locate information about each card.

**Action:**

1. **Structure:** Each line in the file represents a single credit card.
2. **Card Identifier:** The first 19 digits on each line are like a unique ID number for a specific credit card. 
3. **Counter/Reference:** The last two digits on each line are a bit mysterious. They could indicate:
    *  How many times this card has been used.
    *  A reference to another file with more details about this card.
    *  The card's current status (e.g., active, blocked). 

**Business Rules:**

* **Card Tracking:** The file helps us keep track of all active credit cards within our system.
* **Data Organization:**  By assigning a unique identifier to each card, we can easily organize and access information related to that specific card.
* **Potential for Analysis:** The two-digit counter could hold valuable insights for business analysis, such as identifying frequently used cards or cards with potential issues.
