##  Understanding User Data Representation: The COUSR03 Copybook

**File:**  \COUSR03.CPY

This code defines how user information is structured and organized within a larger COBOL application, much like a template or blueprint.

**Context:**

Imagine this code as a digital file folder used to store details about each user, containing fields for their ID, name, type (e.g., administrator, regular user), and even system messages specifically for them.

**Action:**

1. **Structure:** The code defines two layouts (COUSR3AI and COUSR3AO) for the user data, essentially two different ways of looking at the same information. 
    - COUSR3AI: This layout seems designed for internal processing, using compact storage and potentially different character encodings.
    - COUSR3AO: This layout appears geared towards displaying user information, potentially on a screen or report.

2. **Data Fields:** Both layouts contain fields for:
    - User Identification: Fields like USRIDINI to hold the user's unique ID.
    - User Attributes: Fields like FNAMEI and LNAMEI for the user's first and last names, and USRTYPEI for their user type.
    - System Information: Fields like TRNNAMEI (likely transaction name), PGMNAMEI (program name), CURDATEI (current date), and CURTIMEI (current time) to track user actions or context.
    - Messages: A field like ERRMSGI to store system messages intended for the user.

**Business Rules:**

* **User Identification:** Each user is uniquely identifiable, allowing the system to manage permissions and track individual activity.
* **User Attributes:**  The system maintains core user information like name and type, essential for personalization and role-based access.
* **System Tracking:**  By recording transaction, program, date, and time details, the system can monitor user actions for auditing or troubleshooting.
* **User Communication:** The system can relay specific messages to individual users, providing feedback or guidance during their interaction.
