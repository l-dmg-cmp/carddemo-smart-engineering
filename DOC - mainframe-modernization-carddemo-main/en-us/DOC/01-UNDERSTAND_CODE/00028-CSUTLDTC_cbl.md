##  Date Conversion in COBOL: Understanding CSUTLDTC

**File:**  \CSUTLDTC.cbl

This COBOL program acts as a behind-the-scenes date magician, transforming dates from a format we humans understand (like "2024-10-01") into a special format called "Lilian."  This Lilian format, while cryptic to us, is easily understood by computer systems and is often used for calculations and comparisons.

**Context:**

Imagine you're a librarian trying to calculate how many days a book has been overdue.  You wouldn't want to count the days manually, right? Similarly, computers use the Lilian date format to easily calculate the difference between dates, determine day of the week, and more. This program ensures that dates are converted to this computer-friendly format.

**Action:**

1. **Receiving the Date:** The program first receives a date and its format. For example, it might receive "10-01-2024" and "MM-DD-YYYY."
2. **Calling the Expert:**  It then calls upon a specialized function called "CEEDAYS," which is like a date expert residing within the computer system. This function understands various date formats and can convert them to Lilian. 
3. **Validation and Conversion:** The "CEEDAYS" function carefully examines the received date and its format. If everything checks out, it performs the conversion to Lilian.
4. **Error Handling:**  If the date is invalid (e.g., "February 30th") or the format is incorrect, the "CEEDAYS" function informs the program, which then generates an appropriate error message.
5. **Returning the Result:** Finally, the program delivers the converted Lilian date if successful. Otherwise, it provides a descriptive error message indicating the issue, like "Invalid Month" or "Bad Pic String."

**Business Rules:**

* **Accurate Date Handling:**  This program plays a crucial role in ensuring that systems relying on date calculations receive accurate and reliable information.
* **Data Integrity:** By validating dates and formats, the program helps maintain data integrity, preventing errors that could arise from incorrect date information.
* **Error Prevention:**  The detailed error messages generated by the program assist developers in quickly identifying and resolving issues related to date handling, preventing potential problems in applications that use this program.
