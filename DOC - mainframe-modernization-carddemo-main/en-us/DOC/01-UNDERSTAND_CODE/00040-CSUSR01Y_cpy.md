##  Deciphering the User Data Blueprint: A Look at Secure User Storage

**File:**  \CSUSR01Y.cpy

**Context:**

Imagine a secure digital vault where user information is meticulously organized and stored. This code defines the structure of that vault, ensuring that each user's details are kept in order.

**Action:**

1. **Structure:** The code acts as a blueprint, defining a template for storing user data.  Think of it as a digital form with labeled fields for each piece of information.
2. **Functionality:** Each field in the template serves a specific purpose:
    * **SEC-USR-ID:**  This field holds the user's unique identification code, like a digital name tag.
    * **SEC-USR-FNAME and SEC-USR-LNAME:** These fields store the user's first and last names, respectively.
    * **SEC-USR-PWD:**  This field safeguards the user's password, a critical element for authentication and access control.
    * **SEC-USR-TYPE:**  This field indicates the user's role or access level, determining what parts of the system they can interact with.
    * **SEC-USR-FILLER:**  This field is reserved for future expansion, allowing for additional information to be stored as needed.

**Business Rules:**

* **Unique Identification:** Each user must have a unique ID (SEC-USR-ID), ensuring that their information can be easily distinguished and retrieved.
* **Secure Password Storage:**  The user's password (SEC-USR-PWD) is a confidential piece of information that must be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Role-Based Access Control:** The user type (SEC-USR-TYPE) determines the level of access granted to each user, ensuring that only authorized individuals can perform specific actions within the system.
* **Data Integrity:**  The defined structure ensures that user information is stored in a consistent and organized manner, maintaining data integrity and reliability.
