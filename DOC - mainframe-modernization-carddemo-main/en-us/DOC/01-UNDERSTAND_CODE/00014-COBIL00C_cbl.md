## Bill Payment Processing: Understanding Account Payments in CardDemo

**File:**  \src\COBIL00C.cbl

**Context:**

This code handles online bill payments for credit card accounts within the CardDemo application. When a customer chooses to pay their bill online, this part of the system comes into action.

**Action:**

1. **Data Validation:** The code first checks if the customer's input, like the account number, is valid.
2. **Account Lookup:** It retrieves the account details, including the current balance, from the 'ACCTDAT' file.
3. **Confirmation:** Before processing, it prompts the customer to confirm the payment.
4. **Transaction Processing:** Upon confirmation, it generates a unique transaction ID, records the payment details (amount, date, time) in the 'TRANSACT' file, and updates the account balance in the 'ACCTDAT' file.
5. **Payment Confirmation:** Finally, it displays a confirmation message to the customer with the transaction ID.

**Business Rules:**

* **Full Balance Payment:**  This code specifically handles payments for the full outstanding balance on the account. It does not allow partial payments.
* **Confirmation Required:** To prevent accidental payments, the system requires explicit confirmation from the customer before processing the transaction.
* **Unique Transaction ID:** Each payment is assigned a unique ID, which can be used for tracking and reconciliation purposes.
* **Real-time Processing:** The account balance is updated immediately upon successful payment processing.
* **Auditing and Reporting:** All transactions are logged in the 'TRANSACT' file, providing an audit trail for future reference and reporting.
