##  Credit Card Data Layout:  Blueprint for Credit Card Information

**File:**  \COCRDLI.CPY

This code defines how credit card information is structured and organized within a system.  Think of it as a template or blueprint that dictates where each piece of information goes.

**Context:**

In any system dealing with credit cards, you need a standardized way to handle sensitive data like card numbers, account details, and transaction information.  This code provides that standard format.

**Action:**

1. **Two Layouts:**  The code defines two key layouts: 
    * **CCRDLIAI (Internal):** This layout is how the system internally stores and processes credit card information.
    * **CCRDLIAO (External):** This layout is used for exchanging information with external systems or displaying it to users.

2. **Data Fields:**  Both layouts include a range of fields, each designed to hold a specific piece of information:
    * **Transaction Details:**  This could include things like transaction date, time, and type.
    * **Account Data:**  This might include the account number, cardholder name, and billing address.
    * **Card Numbers:**  The actual credit card number is stored securely within this field.
    * **Statuses and Messages:**  Fields to track the status of a transaction (e.g., approved, declined) and provide messages to the user.

3. **Redefining for Different Purposes:**  The code cleverly uses a technique called "REDEFINES" to allow the same data to be interpreted in different ways depending on whether it's being used internally or externally.  

**Business Rules:**

* **Data Standardization:** By defining a clear structure for credit card information, the code ensures that all parts of the system can understand and process the data consistently.
* **Security Considerations:**  While the code snippet doesn't show the specific security measures in place, it highlights the importance of handling sensitive card data with care, likely employing encryption and other security protocols.
* **Flexibility for Communication:**  Having separate internal and external layouts allows the system to communicate effectively with other systems while maintaining internal data structures.
