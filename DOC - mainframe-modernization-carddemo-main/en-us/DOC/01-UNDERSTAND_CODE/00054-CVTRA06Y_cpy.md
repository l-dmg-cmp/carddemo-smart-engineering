##  Unpacking the Daily Transaction Record: A Look at How Card Transactions are Organized

**File:**  \CVTRA06Y.cpy

**Context:**

Imagine this code as the blueprint for a digital container that holds the details of every credit card transaction made by a customer. Just like a physical container would have compartments for organizing items, this code defines the different pieces of information stored for each transaction and how they are arranged. This structured format ensures that transaction data is consistently recorded and easily retrievable for processing and analysis.

**Action:**

This code defines a data structure called "DALYTRAN-RECORD" (short for "Daily Transaction Record"). Think of it as a digital form with specific fields for recording transaction details. Each field represents a particular piece of information, such as:

* **DALYTRAN-ID:** A unique identifier for each transaction (like a transaction number).
* **DALYTRAN-TYPE-CD:** A code indicating the type of transaction (e.g., purchase, refund, cash withdrawal).
* **DALYTRAN-CAT-CD:**  A code categorizing the transaction based on the type of goods or services purchased (e.g., groceries, gas, dining).
* **DALYTRAN-SOURCE:** Where the transaction originated (e.g., online, in-store, ATM).
* **DALYTRAN-DESC:** A brief description of the transaction.
* **DALYTRAN-AMT:** The transaction amount.
* **DALYTRAN-MERCHANT-ID, -NAME, -CITY, -ZIP:** Details about the merchant where the transaction took place.
* **DALYTRAN-CARD-NUM:** The credit card number used for the transaction.
* **DALYTRAN-ORIG-TS, -PROC-TS:** Timestamps indicating when the transaction was initiated and processed.

**Business Rules:**

* **Transaction Identification:**  Each transaction must have a unique ID (DALYTRAN-ID) to distinguish it from others.
* **Transaction Classification:**  Transactions are categorized (DALYTRAN-TYPE-CD, DALYTRAN-CAT-CD) to enable analysis of spending patterns and merchant activity.
* **Merchant Information:**  Recording merchant details allows for tracking transactions by location and merchant, which is essential for fraud prevention and targeted marketing efforts.
* **Time Tracking:**  Storing timestamps (DALYTRAN-ORIG-TS, DALYTRAN-PROC-TS) is crucial for reconstructing transaction history, identifying potential issues, and ensuring accurate processing.
* **Data Security:**  Sensitive information, such as the credit card number (DALYTRAN-CARD-NUM), is stored securely within the transaction record. Access to this data should be strictly controlled to prevent unauthorized access and fraud.
