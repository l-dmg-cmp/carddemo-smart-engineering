##  Understanding Transaction Types in CardDemo

**File:**  \CVTRA03Y.cpy

This code snippet defines how the system categorizes and describes different credit card transactions. Think of it as setting up the rules for labeling each transaction with a specific type and its meaning.

**Context:**

In a credit card system, understanding the nature of each transaction is crucial.  Is it a purchase, a payment, a refund, or something else? This code lays the foundation for accurately identifying and processing each transaction type.

**Action:**

1. **Structure:** The code establishes a structured format called "TRAN-TYPE-RECORD" to hold information about each transaction type.
2. **Type Code:**  It uses a short code (e.g., "SA" for Sale, "RT" for Return) to represent each transaction type, making it easier for the system to process and categorize transactions.
3. **Description:**  Alongside the code, it stores a more descriptive label for each transaction type, making it easily understandable for both the system and anyone reviewing the data.

**Business Rules:**

* **Transaction Classification:**  Every transaction recorded in the system must be associated with a defined transaction type.
* **Code Clarity:**  The use of short codes ensures efficient data processing and storage.
* **Description for Understanding:**  Providing a clear description for each transaction type improves data readability and allows for easier analysis and reporting.
