##  UNUSED-DATA: A Placeholder from the Past?

**File:**  \UNUSED1Y.cpy

This code snippet defines a data structure named `UNUSED-DATA`, essentially creating a template for holding pieces of information.  However, the name "UNUSED" suggests it might be a leftover from a previous version of the system and is not actively used.

**Context:**

Think of a filing cabinet with labeled folders. This code is like creating a new folder labeled "UNUSED-DATA" and then adding smaller compartments within it for specific details.

**Action:**

1. **Structure:** The code sets up a structure named `UNUSED-DATA`.
2. **Data Fields:** Inside this structure, it defines several fields:
    - `UNUSED-ID`:  Likely meant for an identification number, holding up to 8 characters.
    - `UNUSED-FNAME` and `UNUSED-LNAME`: Probably for a first name and last name, each holding up to 20 characters.
    - `UNUSED-PWD`:  Possibly intended for a password, holding up to 8 characters.
    - `UNUSED-TYPE`:  Could be a code or category, holding a single character.
    - `UNUSED-FILLER`: A placeholder for potential future data, holding up to 23 characters. 

**Business Rules:**

* **Data Organization:** The code aimed to organize information related to something called "UNUSED-DATA." However, without further context, the exact purpose of these data fields remains unclear.
* **Potential Legacy:** The name "UNUSED" strongly implies that this data structure, while defined, might not be actively used in the current system. It could be a remnant from a previous version or a placeholder for future development that never materialized.
