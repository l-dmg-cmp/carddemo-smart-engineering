##  Displaying Messages to CardDemo Application Users

**File:**  CSMSG01Y.cpy

This code defines the standard messages presented to users of the CardDemo application.  These messages help users understand the outcome of their actions within the system.

**Context:**

Think of this code as setting the tone for how the CardDemo application communicates with its users.  Whether it's a simple confirmation after a successful action or guidance on correcting an error, these messages play a crucial role in user experience.

**Action:**

1. **Message Storage:** This code defines two messages as fixed pieces of text:
    - **Thank You Message:**  Displayed when a user successfully completes an action, promoting a positive user experience.
    - **Invalid Key Message:** Guides the user to correct their input when they press an invalid key, preventing errors. 

2. **Accessibility:** By defining these messages in a central location, the application can easily reuse them across different functionalities, ensuring consistency in communication. 

**Business Rules:**

* **Clear Communication:**  Providing user-friendly messages like these helps make the CardDemo application more approachable and easier to use.
* **Error Prevention:**  Guiding users with clear error messages like the "Invalid Key Message" reduces the chance of mistakes and frustration.
* **Professionalism:** Consistent and well-worded messages contribute to a more polished and professional image for the CardDemo application.
