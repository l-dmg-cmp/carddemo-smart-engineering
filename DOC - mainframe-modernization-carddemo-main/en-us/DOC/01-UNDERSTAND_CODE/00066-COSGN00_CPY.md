##  Understanding User Login Information

**File:**  \COSGN00.CPY

This code defines how the system stores and handles user login information, like a digital container for user details.

**Context:**

Think of this code as the behind-the-scenes blueprint for managing the information you provide when logging into a system.  It ensures this data is organized and accessible when needed.

**Action:**

1. **Data Organization:**  The code creates two structures, `COSGN0AI` and `COSGN0AO`.  These structures act like templates, defining specific fields for storing information such as:
    -  Transaction Names:  Indicates which operation is being performed (e.g., login, logout).
    -  Screen Titles:  Holds text displayed on the user's screen.
    -  Dates and Times:  Records when actions occur.
    -  User Credentials:  Stores user IDs and passwords securely.
    -  Error Messages: Displays messages to the user in case of issues (e.g., incorrect password). 
2. **Data Flexibility:**  The `REDEFINES` clause allows the system to interpret the same data in different ways.  It's like having multiple views of the same information, depending on the context.

**Business Rules:**

* **Secure Storage:**  The code emphasizes the importance of safeguarding user credentials (user IDs and passwords), which are crucial for system access and security.
* **Error Handling:**  By including a dedicated field for error messages, the code highlights the need to provide clear and informative feedback to users during the login process.
* **Data Integrity:**  The use of structures (`COSGN0AI` and `COSGN0AO`) enforces consistency in how user login information is stored and accessed, ensuring data accuracy and reliability.
