##  Date Validation in the CardDemo Application

**File:**  \src\CSUTLDPY.cpy

This code ensures that dates entered into the CardDemo system are accurate and logical. It's like a gatekeeper, preventing incorrect or nonsensical dates from causing issues.

**Context:**

Imagine a customer applying for a credit card through the CardDemo application. They need to enter their birthdate.  This code swings into action to make sure the date they provide makes sense.

**Action:**

1. **Format Check:** The code first confirms that the date is entered in the correct format (YYYYMMDD). 
2. **Component Validation:** It then dissects the date into its individual parts (year, month, day) and validates each one. 
    * **Year:**  The code checks for a reasonable century (19xx or 20xx) to prevent errors like someone accidentally entering their birth year as 1850.
    * **Month:** It makes sure the month is between 1 and 12.
    * **Day:** It verifies that the day falls within the valid range for the given month (e.g., not February 30th). 
3. **Leap Year Logic:**  The code includes special handling for February, ensuring that February 29th is only accepted in leap years.
4. **Future Date Prevention:**  To prevent someone from entering a future date of birth, the code compares the provided date to the current date.
5. **External Verification (Optional):** The code can optionally utilize an external service (`CSUTLDTC`) for additional, rigorous date validation.

**Business Rules:**

* **Data Integrity:**  Accurate dates are crucial for many aspects of credit card management, including calculating interest, determining eligibility, and generating reports. This code acts as a safeguard against data corruption.
* **User Experience:**  While invisible to the user, this code prevents frustrating scenarios like applications being rejected due to simple date entry errors. It contributes to a smoother and more user-friendly experience.
* **Compliance:** Financial institutions often have strict regulations regarding data accuracy. This code helps the CardDemo application comply with these standards.
