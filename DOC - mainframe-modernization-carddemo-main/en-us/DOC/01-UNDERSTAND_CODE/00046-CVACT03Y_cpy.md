##  Understanding Card Cross-Reference Data

**File:**  \CVACT03Y.cpy

This code defines the structure of a single record used to connect a credit card with a customer and their account. Think of it like a digital index card that helps the system quickly locate and access information.

**Context:**

In a system managing credit cards, you need a way to link a specific card number to the right customer and their corresponding account. This code provides the format for storing these relationships.

**Action:**

1. **Structure:** The code defines a structure named `CARD-XREF-RECORD`. This structure acts as a template for holding the related pieces of information.
2. **Card Number:**  The `XREF-CARD-NUM` field stores the actual credit card number.
3. **Customer ID:** The `XREF-CUST-ID` field stores a unique identifier for the customer.
4. **Account ID:** The `XREF-ACCT-ID` field stores a unique identifier for the account associated with the card.
5. **Filler:** The `FILLER` field is unused space, potentially reserved for future expansion or compatibility.

**Business Rules:**

* **Unique Identification:** Each credit card has a unique number that links it to a specific customer and their account.
* **Data Integrity:** This cross-reference ensures that transactions and information are correctly attributed to the right customer and account.
* **Efficient Retrieval:**  The structured format allows the system to quickly search and retrieve customer and account information using the card number.
