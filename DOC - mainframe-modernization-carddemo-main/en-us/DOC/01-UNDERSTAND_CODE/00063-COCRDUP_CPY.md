##  Understanding Data Structures for Duplicate Credit Card Checks

**File:**  \src\COCRDUP.CPY

This code defines how credit card information is organized for checking for duplicates in a COBOL system. Think of it as a template for holding and processing credit card data.

**Context:**

In systems that handle sensitive information like credit card numbers, it's crucial to have mechanisms in place to prevent duplication. This code snippet plays a role in that process by defining how credit card data is structured for duplicate checks.

**Action:**

1. **Data Organization:** The code defines two structures, `CCRDUPAI` and `CCRDUPAO`, which act as blueprints for organizing credit card information. These structures contain fields for storing various pieces of data related to a credit card, such as:
    - **Transaction Information:** Details about the transaction, like the transaction name, date, and time.
    - **Credit Card Details:** Important credit card information, including the account ID, card number, cardholder name, expiration date, and status.
    - **Messages and Keys:** Fields for storing informational messages, error messages, and function keys used for user interaction.
2. **Data Representation:** The code uses specific formats to represent the data, ensuring compatibility with the system's internal processing. 
3. **Dual Formatting:** The code defines two different formats for the data: one for internal processing (`CCRDUPAI`) and another for displaying the information on a screen (`CCRDUPAO`). This dual formatting allows the system to efficiently process the data while also presenting it in a user-friendly way.

**Business Rules:**

* **Data Integrity:**  By defining specific data structures, the code ensures that credit card information is stored and processed consistently, minimizing the risk of errors.
* **Duplicate Prevention:** The organized structure of credit card data facilitates the process of checking for duplicates, helping to prevent fraudulent activities and maintain the accuracy of the system.
* **User-Friendliness:** The use of separate formats for internal processing and display ensures that while the system works with data efficiently, users can still view and interact with the information in a clear and understandable format.
