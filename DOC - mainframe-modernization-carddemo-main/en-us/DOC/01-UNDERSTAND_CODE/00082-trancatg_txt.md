##  Understanding Transaction Categories: A Look at "trancatg.txt"

**File:**  trancatg.txt

**Context:**

Imagine this file as a dictionary that defines different types of actions you can take with a credit card. Each code in this file represents a specific financial transaction, like buying groceries, withdrawing cash, or making a payment.

**Action:**

This file acts like a list, where each line describes a unique transaction:

1. **Transaction Code:** This is a unique number assigned to each type of transaction. For example, "010001" might represent "Regular Sales Draft," which is just a fancy term for buying something with your credit card.
2. **Transaction Description:** This part explains in simple words what the code means. So, instead of seeing just "010001," you'll see "010001 Regular Sales Draft," making it much clearer.
3. **Unknown Value (Possibly Padding):**  Think of this as extra space on each line. It's there for technical reasons and doesn't affect the meaning of the transaction.

**Business Rules:**

* **Categorization:** This file helps in organizing and understanding different types of credit card transactions.  
* **Reporting:** These codes likely play a role in generating reports, allowing businesses to track things like the total amount of cash advances or the number of online purchases made.
* **System Integration:** These codes are likely used by different computer systems to communicate with each other. For example, when you make a purchase, the code helps ensure that the correct type of transaction is recorded.
