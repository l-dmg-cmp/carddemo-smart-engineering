##  User Information Structure: A Look at COUSR00.CPY

**File:**  \COUSR00.CPY

This code defines the blueprint for handling user information, much like a digital form for user data. It sets the stage for displaying, capturing, and potentially updating details about users in the system.

**Context:**

Imagine this code as the foundation for any screen or report within the application that interacts with user data. Whether it's a list of users, a user profile update screen, or a report displaying user activity, this structure dictates how the information is organized.

**Action:**

1. **Structure:** The code defines two main structures: `COUSR0AI` (likely for input) and `COUSR0AO` (likely for output). Both structures are essentially mirrors of each other, but with different ways of representing the data. This is evident from the `REDEFINES` clause, indicating that the same memory location can be interpreted differently.

2. **Functionality:** Each structure contains a collection of fields that hold various pieces of user information, such as:
   * **User ID:** A unique identifier for each user.
   * **First Name:** The user's first name.
   * **Last Name:** The user's last name.
   * **User Type:**  A code indicating the type of user (e.g., administrator, standard user).
   * **Selection Flags:**  Likely checkboxes or indicators to select specific users.
   * **System Information:** Fields like transaction name, program name, date, time, and page number provide context to the data being displayed.

3. **Technologies:** The code is written in COBOL, a programming language commonly used in mainframe systems for business applications. The absence of any database-specific keywords suggests that the data is likely stored in files.

**Business Rules:**

* **User Identification:** The `USRID` field is crucial as it uniquely identifies each user within the system. This is essential for maintaining data integrity and associating actions or transactions with the correct user.

* **User Type Differentiation:**  The `UTYPE` field implies different user roles and potentially different levels of access or permissions within the application. This is a common security practice in systems where not all users should have equal privileges.

* **Data Presentation and Manipulation:** The dual structure approach (input and output) highlights the need to handle data differently depending on whether it's being displayed to the user or processed internally by the application. For instance, dates might be stored in a specific format internally but displayed in a more user-friendly way.
