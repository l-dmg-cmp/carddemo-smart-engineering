## Daily Transaction Processor: Handling Credit Card Charges and Payments

**File:**  \src\CBTRN02C.cbl

**Context:**

This program forms the heart of the daily credit card processing system. Imagine a queue of transactions - purchases, payments, and other activities - waiting to be applied to customer accounts. This program takes each transaction, checks if it's valid, and updates the accounts accordingly.

**Action:**

1. **Setup (Opening Files):**  The program starts by opening all the necessary files containing customer data, transaction details, and account balances. It's like laying out all the tools and materials before starting a project.
2. **Transaction Processing (The Main Loop):**  The program goes through each transaction, one by one. For each transaction:
    * **Validation:** It checks if the card number is valid, the account exists, and if the transaction would exceed the credit limit or use an expired card.
    * **Updating Balances:** If the transaction is valid, the program updates:
        * **Transaction Category Balance:** This keeps track of totals for different types of transactions (e.g., purchases, payments).
        * **Account Balance:** The customer's account balance is adjusted (increased for payments, decreased for purchases).
    * **Recording the Transaction:** The transaction, along with a timestamp, is saved for future reference.
    * **Handling Rejections:** If a transaction fails validation (like an invalid card number), it's marked with a reason and written to a separate file for investigation.
3. **Cleanup (Closing Files):**  Once all transactions are processed, the program closes all the files, much like putting away tools after finishing the job.

**Business Rules:**

* **Credit Limit:**  The system ensures that a transaction doesn't go through if it would put the account over its credit limit.
* **Card Expiration:**  Transactions are rejected if the card used is past its expiration date.
* **Transaction Categorization:**  Transactions are categorized, allowing the business to track different types of activities (e.g., to see if there's a surge in a particular type of purchase).
* **Rejection Handling:**  Invalid transactions are logged with reasons, providing an audit trail for investigation and potential follow-up.
