## Credit Card List: Displaying and Navigating Credit Card Information

**File:**  \COCRDLIC.cbl

This program, `COCRDLIC.cbl`, is the engine behind displaying and navigating a list of credit cards to users. It determines which cards a user can see and how they interact with that list.

**Context:**

Imagine a user interface (think old-school green screen) where a user can view a list of credit cards. This program manages everything about that list - what's displayed, how the user moves through the pages, and what happens when they select a card.

**Action:**

1. **User Access Control:**  The program first checks if the user is an administrator. Admins see all credit cards, while regular users only see cards linked to their specific account number.
2. **Displaying the List:** The program fetches credit card data (likely from a database) and neatly presents it on the screen.  It handles the formatting and organization of this list.
3. **Navigation:** Users can move through pages of results using function keys (like pressing F7 for the previous page and F8 for the next). The program keeps track of the user's position within the list.
4. **Card Selection:** If a user wants to view details about a specific card, they can select it (perhaps using another function key). The program then passes the selected card's information to another program designed for viewing details.

**Business Rules:**

* **Security:**  User roles (admin vs. regular user) determine the visibility of credit card information, ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized personnel.
* **Efficiency:**  The program allows for navigating through potentially large datasets of credit cards, ensuring a user-friendly experience even with many records.
* **Modularity:** The program is designed to work seamlessly with other parts of the application. It can receive instructions (like an account number to filter by) and can pass selected card information to other programs for further actions.
