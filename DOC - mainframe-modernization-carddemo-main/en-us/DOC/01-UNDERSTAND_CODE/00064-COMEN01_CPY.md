## Deciphering the Common Data Structure: COMEN01.CPY

**File:** \COMEN01.CPY

**Context:**

Think of this code as a blueprint defining a container named COMEN01.  This container is designed to hold pieces of information commonly used across different operations in our system. It ensures consistency and organization, much like using standardized forms in a business.

**Action:**

1. **Structure:** The code defines the layout of our container (COMEN01) with labeled compartments for storing various data points.
2. **Functionality:** Each compartment has a specific purpose:
    - **TRNNAMEL/TRNNAMEF:** Stores a transaction name, like "ACTVW" (Account View), in different formats. 
    - **TITLE01L/TITLE01F:** Holds a title or heading, such as "Account Details," again in multiple formats.
    - **CURDATEL/CURDATEF:** Contains the current date in different representations.
    - **PGMNAMEL/PGMNAMEF:** Stores the name of the program or module being used.
    - **TITLE02L/TITLE02F:** Holds another title or heading, offering flexibility for displaying information.
    - **CURTIMEL/CURTIMEF:** Contains the current time in different formats.
    - **OPTN001L to OPTN012L/OPTN001F to OPTN012F:**  These compartments store up to twelve options that might be presented to the user, like a menu with multiple choices.
    - **OPTIONL/OPTIONF:** Holds the user's selected option.
    - **ERRMSGL/ERRMSGF:**  Stores error messages if something goes wrong, providing feedback to the user.
3. **Technologies:** This blueprint uses COBOL, a programming language well-suited for organizing and handling data, especially in systems that manage transactions and records.
4. **Best Practices:** The code utilizes "REDEFINES," which allows the same data to be accessed and presented in different ways depending on the need.

**Business Rules:**

* **Standardization:**  By defining a common structure for frequently used data, we ensure consistency and simplify data handling across different parts of the system.
* **Flexibility:** The use of REDEFINES provides flexibility in presenting and processing data, adapting to various scenarios within the application.
* **User Interaction:**  The inclusion of titles, options, and error messages highlights the importance of clear communication with the user, guiding them through the system's functionalities.
* **Transaction Tracking:**  Storing transaction names and timestamps helps in monitoring system activities, tracing back operations, and analyzing usage patterns.
