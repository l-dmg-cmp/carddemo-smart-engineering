## Disk Group Configuration Mapping

**File:**  \discgrp.txt

**Context:**

This file acts like a blueprint for organizing storage space, similar to how folders on your computer group related files.  Each line in the file dictates how specific data groups, identified by unique codes, should be allocated storage resources.

**Action:**

1. **Mapping Structure:** The file follows a simple pattern:  
   - **Group Identifier:** A code (e.g., `A000000000010001`, `ZEROAPR`) representing a specific data group.
   - **Configuration Values:** A set of numbers and characters (e.g., `01000100150{0000000000000000000000000000`) likely defining storage parameters for that group.

2. **Functionality:** While the exact meaning of the configuration values isn't provided, they likely control aspects such as:
   - **Disk Allocation:**  Which physical disks or storage pools the group's data should reside on.
   - **Performance Settings:**  Options to potentially prioritize speed or redundancy for the data group.
   - **Capacity Limits:**  Maximum storage space that can be used by the group.

**Business Rules:**

* **Data Segregation:** The file suggests a system designed to manage various categories of data separately. This allows for tailored storage strategies based on the importance, access frequency, or sensitivity of different data types.
* **Predefined Allocation:** The use of specific identifiers implies that storage allocation is determined in advance. This could be based on factors like the expected volume of data for each group, performance requirements, or regulatory constraints. 
* **Potential for Customization:** The presence of a "DEFAULT" identifier suggests a baseline configuration that can be overridden for specific groups (e.g., `ZEROAPR`) requiring unique storage settings.
