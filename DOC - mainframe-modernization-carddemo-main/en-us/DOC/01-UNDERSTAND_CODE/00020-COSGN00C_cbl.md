##  Decoding the Sign-on Process for CardDemo Application

**File:**  \COSGN00C.cbl

This code handles the sign-on process for the CardDemo application, a system used for managing credit cards. It ensures that only authorized users can access the application and directs them to the appropriate part of the system based on their user type.

**Context:**

Imagine you're a customer service representative for a credit card company. Before you can access any customer information or perform any transactions, you need to log in to the CardDemo application. This code handles that login process, verifying your credentials and granting you access to the appropriate features.

**Action:**

1. **Display Sign-on Screen:**  The code starts by displaying a sign-on screen to the user where they need to enter their User ID and Password.
2. **Capture User Input:** When the user presses Enter, the code collects the entered User ID and Password.
3. **Validate User Credentials:** It then checks if the entered User ID exists in the system. If it does, the code compares the entered Password against the one stored in the system for that specific User ID.
4. **Determine User Type:**  Upon successful validation, the code identifies the user's role (e.g., administrator or regular user). 
5. **Direct User to Appropriate Menu:** Based on the user type, the code redirects the user to the relevant part of the application. Administrators might be directed to an admin menu with specific functionalities, while regular users might land on the main menu.

**Business Rules:**

* **Security:** Only users with valid credentials (correct User ID and Password combination) are granted access to the application. This ensures that sensitive customer and financial data is protected from unauthorized access.
* **Role-Based Access Control:**  Different user types have access to different functionalities within the application. This ensures that users only see and interact with information and features relevant to their role. For example, a regular user wouldn't have access to administrative functions like adding new users or changing system settings.
