## Account Update Program for CardDemo Application

**File:**  COACTUPC.cbl

This COBOL program allows authorized users to view and update customer account information within the CardDemo application. 

**Context:**

Think of this program as the backend engine that powers the account update functionality for a credit card management system. When a customer service representative needs to modify a customer's account details, this program handles all the necessary steps.

**Action:**

1. **Initialization:** The program starts by setting up the necessary variables and preparing the system for interaction with the user.
2. **Input Processing:** It receives input from the user through a screen interface. This includes account details like credit limit, cash limit, current balance, and customer information like name, address, and contact details.
3. **Data Validation:** The program rigorously checks the entered information to ensure it meets specific criteria. For instance, it validates that the account number is numeric, the credit limit is a positive number, and the phone number is in the correct format.
4. **Data Retrieval:** It fetches existing account and customer data from VSAM files based on the provided account number.
5. **Data Comparison:**  The program compares the new data entered by the user with the existing data retrieved from the database. This helps identify any changes made by the user.
6. **Update Confirmation:** If changes are detected, the program prompts the user to confirm the update. This step acts as a safety net, preventing accidental modifications.
7. **Data Update:** Upon confirmation, the program updates both the account and customer records in the VSAM files with the new information.
8. **Concurrency Check:** The program incorporates a mechanism to check if another user has modified the same data while the current update was in progress. This prevents data inconsistencies that might arise from simultaneous updates.

**Technologies:**

* **COBOL:** A robust programming language commonly used for mainframe applications, chosen for its reliability and ability to handle large volumes of data.
* **CICS:** A transaction processing system that manages user interactions and communication with the mainframe, ensuring smooth and efficient processing.
* **VSAM:** A file management system used for storing and retrieving data on the mainframe, providing fast access to account and customer information.

**Business Rules:**

* **Data Integrity:** The program enforces strict data validation rules to ensure the accuracy and consistency of account information.
* **Authorization:** Only authorized users, like customer service representatives, are allowed to access and modify account data.
* **Audit Trail:** All updates are tracked to maintain a history of changes made to each account, ensuring accountability and traceability.
* **Concurrency Control:** The program handles concurrent updates to prevent data corruption and ensure that changes made by one user do not overwrite those made by another.
* **Data Security:**  Sensitive data like customer SSN and financial information is handled with care, adhering to security best practices to protect customer privacy.
