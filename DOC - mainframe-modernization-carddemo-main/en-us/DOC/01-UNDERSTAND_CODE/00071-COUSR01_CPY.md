## Understanding User Information Storage: COUSR01 Copybook

**File:**  \src\COUSR01.CPY

This code defines how user information is organized and stored within a system. Think of it like a digital template for a user profile.

**Context:**

Whenever a system needs to work with user details – like during login, displaying a user profile, or updating account information – it refers to this template to understand how the data is structured.

**Action:**

1. **Two Views of Data:** The code defines two ways of looking at the same user information:
   - **COUSR1AI:** This is like a detailed list of user attributes, each with a label and space to store the value.  Imagine fields for "First Name," "Last Name," "User ID," "Password," and so on.
   - **COUSR1AO:** This offers an alternative way to access the same data, potentially grouping related fields together or formatting them differently. For example, it might combine the user's first and last name into a single "Full Name" field. 

2. **Data Types and Sizes:**  The code specifies the type and length of each piece of information. This ensures that the system allocates the right amount of storage and interprets the data correctly. 

**Business Rules:**

* **User Identification:** The copybook includes fields for storing unique identifiers like "User ID" and "Password," essential for user authentication and access control.
* **Personal Information:** Fields like "First Name" and "Last Name" capture basic user details for personalization and record-keeping.
* **User Type:**  A field for "User Type" likely differentiates between various user roles and their corresponding permissions within the system (e.g., administrator, standard user).
* **Error Handling:** The inclusion of an "Error Message" field suggests that the system has mechanisms for handling and communicating errors related to user data, such as invalid login attempts or data validation failures.
