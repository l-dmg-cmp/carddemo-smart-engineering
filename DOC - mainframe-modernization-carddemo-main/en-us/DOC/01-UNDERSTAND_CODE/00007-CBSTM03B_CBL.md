##  Card Transaction File Processor Subroutine

**File:**  \src\CBSTM03B.CBL

**Context:**

This code is a subroutine, a small program within a larger system, designed to manage credit card transactions. It's like a librarian who fetches specific files (customer data, account details, transaction records) upon request. This subroutine ensures the smooth operation of a batch processing system, where large volumes of transactions are processed automatically.

**Action:**

1. **File Access:** The subroutine is designed to handle four key files:
    - **Transaction File (TRNX-FILE):** Contains details of each credit card transaction.
    - **Cross-Reference File (XREF-FILE):** Links credit card numbers to specific accounts.
    - **Customer File (CUST-FILE):** Holds personal information about each customer.
    - **Account File (ACCT-FILE):** Stores details about each credit card account (balance, credit limit, etc.).
2. **Request Processing:** The main program signals what action it needs (open, read, close) on which file using specific codes ('TRNXFILE', 'XREFFILE', etc.) and provides the necessary keys (like account number) to locate specific information.
3. **File Operations:** Based on the request, the subroutine opens the relevant file, reads data from it, or closes it after the operation is complete. 
4. **Error Handling:** The subroutine also diligently checks for any issues during file operations (e.g., file not found) and reports them back to the main program.

**Business Rules:**

* **Data Organization:**  The use of separate files for transactions, cross-references, customers, and accounts ensures organized data management within the system.
* **Sequential Processing:** The subroutine is designed for batch processing, handling transactions one after the other from the Transaction File.
* **Data Retrieval:**  It retrieves specific customer, account, and transaction data based on provided keys, ensuring accurate processing.
* **Security & Integrity:** By handling file operations within a controlled subroutine, the system maintains data integrity and security.
