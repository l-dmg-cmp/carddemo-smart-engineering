##  Deciphering Transaction Categories in CardDemo

**File:**  \CVTRA04Y.cpy

This code defines the structure of how the CardDemo application stores information about different categories of transactions. Think of it as a template for a container that holds details about each type of transaction.

**Context:**

In a system managing credit cards, understanding the types of transactions is crucial. This code provides a standardized way to categorize and store information about each transaction, such as purchases, payments, cash advances, or fees.

**Action:**

1. **Structure:** The code defines a structure named `TRAN-CAT-RECORD`. This structure acts as a container for holding information about a single transaction category.

2. **Key Identification:** Inside the `TRAN-CAT-RECORD`, there's a `TRAN-CAT-KEY` which uniquely identifies each transaction category. It consists of:
   - `TRAN-TYPE-CD`: A two-character code representing the general type of transaction (e.g., 'PR' for Purchase, 'PA' for Payment).
   - `TRAN-CAT-CD`: A four-digit code that further categorizes the transaction within its type (e.g., '0001' for Online Purchase, '0002' for In-store Purchase under the 'PR' type).

3. **Description:** The `TRAN-CAT-TYPE-DESC` field provides a short description of the transaction category, up to 50 characters long. This helps users understand the category's purpose.

**Business Rules:**

* **Transaction Classification:** The code enforces a two-level categorization for transactions, using a combination of type and category codes. This allows the system to handle a wide range of transaction types with specific details.
* **Unique Identification:** Each transaction category must have a unique combination of `TRAN-TYPE-CD` and `TRAN-CAT-CD`, ensuring that every category is distinct within the system.
* **Clear Description:** The descriptive field ensures that each category is easily understandable, aiding in reporting, analysis, and user interface displays.
