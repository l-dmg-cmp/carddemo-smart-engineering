##  Viewing a Transaction: How We Display Transaction Details

**File:**  \src\COTRN01C.cbl

This code forms part of the CardDemo application, a system used to manage credit card transactions. Specifically, this program, COTRN01C, allows users to view the details of a specific transaction.

**Context:**

Imagine a call center representative needs to quickly access details about a specific transaction, perhaps to answer a customer's query.  They would use this program, COTRN01C, to find and display the necessary information.

**Action:**

1. **Input:** The program first receives a transaction ID, which acts like a unique reference number for each transaction. This ID is entered by the user, likely the call center representative in our example.
2. **Data Retrieval:** The program then searches for the transaction matching the provided ID within a database called TRANSACT. This database stores information about all transactions.
3. **Display:** If the transaction is found, the program neatly presents all the relevant details on the user's screen. This could include the transaction amount, date, card number, merchant details, and more.
4. **Error Handling:** If the entered transaction ID is blank or doesn't match any record in the database, the program displays an error message, guiding the user to enter a valid ID.

**Business Rules:**

* **Unique Transaction ID:** Each transaction is assigned a unique ID, ensuring that the correct transaction details are retrieved and displayed. This is crucial for accurate record keeping and customer service.
* **Secure Data Access:** The program interacts with the TRANSACT database in a controlled manner, retrieving only the necessary information for the specified transaction ID. This ensures data security and prevents unauthorized access.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** The program presents transaction details in a clear and organized format, making it easy for the user to understand the information. This is essential for efficient customer service and transaction management.
