**File:**  \src\CBTRN03C.cbl

This COBOL program, a key part of the CardDemo application, is like a chef preparing a detailed recipe (report) from a list of ingredients (transaction data). It reads credit card transaction records, gathers related information from other files (like a cookbook), and presents a well-structured report.

**Context:**

Imagine you're a business owner wanting a clear picture of your customers' credit card transactions. This program takes raw transaction data and transforms it into a digestible report, showing individual transactions, totals per page and account, and a final grand total for a specific period.

**Action:**

1. **Gathering Ingredients:** The program starts by opening various files containing transaction details, customer information, transaction types, and date ranges.
2. **Following the Recipe:** It then reads each transaction record and retrieves corresponding details from the other files, similar to a chef cross-referencing ingredients with a cookbook.
3. **Cooking up the Report:**  The program meticulously formats this information into a report, calculating and displaying page totals, account totals, and a grand total.
4. **Serving the Dish:** Finally, the program closes all the files, marking the end of the report generation process.

**Business Rules:**

* **Transaction Processing:** The program processes credit card transactions, which are the core business of the CardDemo application.
* **Report Generation:** It generates a detailed report summarizing transactions, crucial for financial analysis and reconciliation.
* **Data Integrity:** The program ensures data consistency by cross-referencing transaction details with other relevant files.
* **Date Range Filtering:** It filters transactions based on a specific date range, providing a focused view of business activity.
* **Data Aggregation:** The program calculates and displays page totals, account totals, and a grand total, summarizing financial data.
