##  Navigating the Admin Panel: A Look into CardDemo's Control Center

**File:**  \src\COADM01C.cbl

This code forms the administrative hub of the "CardDemo" application, a system designed to manage credit card operations. Imagine this as the control panel for authorized personnel, offering a menu of administrative tasks.

**Context:**

Think of a user with special access logging into the CardDemo system. Instead of the usual options like viewing transactions or paying bills, they are greeted with a screen specifically designed for administrative tasks. This code is what generates that screen and handles the user's interactions with it.

**Action:**

1. **Presenting the Menu:** The code starts by displaying a list of administrative options. These could include actions like "Manage Users," "Generate Reports," or any other function deemed exclusive to administrators.
2. **Capturing the Choice:**  It patiently waits for the administrator to select an option from the menu, using either the mouse or keyboard.
3. **Input Validation:** Before taking any action, the code quickly checks if the chosen option is valid. This ensures that the system doesn't encounter errors due to incorrect input.
4. **Directing Traffic:**  Based on the selected option, the code acts like a traffic controller, directing the administrator to the appropriate section of the application. For instance, choosing "Manage Users" would lead to a different part of the system dedicated to user administration.

**Business Rules:**

* **Restricted Access:** This menu is exclusively for authorized administrators, ensuring that sensitive operations are protected from unauthorized access.
* **Centralized Admin Panel:** The code provides a single, organized location for administrators to perform various management tasks, streamlining administrative workflows.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** The menu-driven approach offers a clear and intuitive way for administrators to interact with the system, even if they are not familiar with complex commands or technical details.
