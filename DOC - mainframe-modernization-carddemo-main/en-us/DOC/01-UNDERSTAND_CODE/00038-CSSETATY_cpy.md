## Decoding Screen Color Logic in CardDemo Application

**File:**  `\CardDemo Application\Copybooks\CSSETATY.cpy`

This code snippet is like a small set of instructions within a larger program called CardDemo, which likely manages credit card information. It focuses on how a specific field on the screen should look based on certain conditions related to a variable we'll call `(TESTVAR1)`.

**Context:**

Imagine you're a customer service representative using the CardDemo application to access customer account details. You've just entered some information, perhaps a customer's credit card number or a transaction amount. This code snippet determines how the system visually responds to your input.

**Action:**

1. **Error Check:** The code first checks if the variable `(TESTVAR1)` signals an error (like invalid input) or if a specific field is empty.
2. **Highlight in Red:** If there's an error, the code turns the field labeled `(SCRNVAR2)` red on your screen. This visual cue immediately alerts you that something is wrong with the information you entered.
3. **Mark Empty Fields:** If the field is empty, the code places an asterisk (*) inside it. This helps you quickly identify fields that still need attention.

**Business Rules:**

* **Visual Feedback:** By changing the field color to red and using an asterisk, the system provides clear and immediate visual feedback to the user, highlighting potential errors or missing information.
* **Error Prevention:** This real-time validation helps prevent incorrect data from being entered into the system, ensuring data accuracy and integrity.
* **Improved User Experience:** The visual cues guide the user, making data entry more intuitive and reducing the likelihood of mistakes.
