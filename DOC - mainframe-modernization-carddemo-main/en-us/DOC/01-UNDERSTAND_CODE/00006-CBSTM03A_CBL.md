**File:**  \src\CBSTM03A.CBL

**Context:**

This program is the engine behind those account statements you receive, detailing every transaction, your balance, and even your credit score. It gathers information from various sources to present a clear picture of your financial activity.

**Action:**

1. **Data Gathering:** Imagine the program has different trays for customer data, account details, and transaction history. It pulls information from each tray based on your account number.
2. **Statement Construction:** Like a meticulous clerk, the program organizes the collected information into a clear and readable format. It arranges your name, address, account balance, and credit score at the top.
3. **Transaction Listing:** Next, it meticulously lists your transactions, one by one, including the date, description, and amount.  Think of it as categorizing and neatly arranging receipts on a spreadsheet.
4. **Total Calculation:**  The program adds up all your transactions to calculate your total expenses for the statement period.
5. **Statement Production:** Finally, the program generates two versions of your statement: a plain text version (like a traditional bank statement) and a modern HTML version that can be viewed online.

**Business Rules:**

* **Data Integrity:** The program ensures that data from different sources is accurately matched and presented. For instance, it makes sure that transactions are linked to the correct account.
* **Clarity and Transparency:** The generated statement is designed to be easy to understand, providing a clear overview of all account activity. 
* **Flexibility:** By producing both plain text and HTML versions, the program caters to different preferences and delivery methods.
* **Confidentiality:**  While not explicitly stated, the program likely incorporates security measures to protect your sensitive financial information.
