##  Daily Transaction Processing: Making Sense of Card Transactions in CardDemo

**File:**  \src\CBTRN01C.cbl

This COBOL program forms the backbone of CardDemo's daily transaction processing. It reads customer transactions from a file, verifies card details, retrieves account information, and prepares to update transaction records. 

**Context:**

Think of a queue of customer transactions waiting to be processed at the end of each day. This program is like the diligent bank teller who meticulously goes through each transaction, ensures everything is in order, and prepares to update the records.

**Action:**

1. **File Preparation:** The program starts by opening all necessary files: daily transactions, customer details, card-account cross-references, card information, account details, and transaction records.  It's like the teller getting their desk ready with all the necessary documents.
2. **Transaction Processing:** It then reads each transaction from the daily transaction file. For each transaction:
    * **Card Verification:** The program verifies the card number against a cross-reference file to ensure it's valid. Imagine the teller checking the card number against their records.
    * **Account Retrieval:** If the card is valid, the program retrieves the associated account information. This is like the teller finding the customer's account based on the card details.
    * **Preparation for Update:** The program then prepares to update the transaction records. The exact update logic is not included in this code snippet.  This would be similar to the teller calculating balances and preparing to record the transaction in the system.
3. **File Closure:**  After processing all transactions, the program closes all the files it opened at the beginning. It's like the teller putting everything back in order at the end of their shift.

**Business Rules:**

* **Card Verification:** Every card used in a transaction must be verified against the CardDemo system's records to prevent fraud and ensure accurate processing.
* **Account Linking:** Each valid card must be linked to a customer account to correctly reflect transactions and balances.
* **Transaction Logging:** All processed transactions are recorded, though the specific details of how this is done are not present in this code excerpt. This ensures a complete and auditable history of all activities.
