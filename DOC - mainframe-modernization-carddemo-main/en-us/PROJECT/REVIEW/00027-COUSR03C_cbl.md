## Technical Analysis Review

**File:**  \src\COUSR03C.cbl

**Title:**  Delete User Module (CICS COBOL Program)

**Summary:** 

This CICS COBOL program, `COUSR03C`, is part of the `CardDemo` application. Its primary function is to handle the deletion of user records from a file named `USRSEC`. It interacts with CICS for screen handling (using maps `COUSR3A` and `COUSR03`) and data access. The program receives user input, retrieves user information from the `USRSEC` file, displays it to the user for confirmation, and then processes the deletion upon user confirmation. 

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL
* **Framework/Library:** CICS (Customer Information Control System) for transaction processing and screen interaction.
* **Database:**  
   * **VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method):** While not explicitly stated, the `USRSEC` file is likely a VSAM file based on the usage within a CICS COBOL context. 
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`

**Reference, Class and Method:**

| Reference | Description |
|---|---|
| `COCOM01Y` |  Likely contains a data structure (`CDEMO-CU03-INFO`) related to the specific user interface or data being passed between modules in the `CardDemo` application. |
| `COUSR03` |  Probably defines the structure of the `COUSR3AI` and `COUSR3AO` maps used for screen input/output. |
| `COTTL01Y` |  Potentially holds common title or header information layouts used across the application. |
| `CSDAT01Y` |  Likely contains date-related data structures and variables. |
| `CSMSG01Y` |  May define message-related data structures or constants used for displaying messages to the user. |
| `CSUSR01Y` |  Could contain user-related data structures or variables. |
| `DFHAID` |  Provides definitions for symbolic names of the attention identifier byte (EIBAID), which is used to determine which key the user pressed. |
| `DFHBMSCA` |  Provides definitions for symbolic names of the control area (EIB), which is used to communicate with CICS. |

| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` |  |

| Method(Public) | Description |
|---|---|
| `MAIN-PARA` | The main entry point of the program. It controls the overall flow of the program, handling user interaction and data processing. |
| `PROCESS-ENTER-KEY` |  Processes user input when the Enter key is pressed. It validates the entered User ID and retrieves user details from the `USRSEC` file. | 
| `DELETE-USER-INFO` |  Handles the deletion process. It retrieves the user record from the `USRSEC` file and performs the deletion operation. |
| `RETURN-TO-PREV-SCREEN` |  Manages the transfer of control back to the previous screen. |
| `SEND-USRDEL-SCREEN` |  Sends the `COUSR3A` map to the user's terminal to display information about the user to be deleted. |
| `RECEIVE-USRDEL-SCREEN` | Receives user input from the `COUSR3A` map. |
| `POPULATE-HEADER-INFO` |  Populates header information on the screen, including the current date and time. |
| `READ-USER-SEC-FILE` |  Reads a user record from the `USRSEC` file. |
| `DELETE-USER-SEC-FILE` |  Deletes a user record from the `USRSEC` file. |
| `CLEAR-CURRENT-SCREEN` |  Clears the current screen content. |
| `INITIALIZE-ALL-FIELDS` |  Initializes data fields used by the program. |
