## Technical Analysis Review

**File:**  \src\COADM01C.cbl

**Title:**  Admin Menu for Admin users

**Summary:** 

This COBOL program, `COADM01C.CBL`, presents an administrative menu within the 'CardDemo' application.  It handles user interaction, displaying menu options and processing user selections to transition to other programs within the CICS environment. The program is designed to interact with a user via a 3270 terminal screen, sending and receiving data through maps. 

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL
* **Framework/Library:** CICS (Customer Information Control System)
* **Database:**  While the code doesn't directly interact with a database within this file, it references a file named 'USRSEC  ' (WS-USRSEC-FILE) suggesting potential user security data handling.
* **Others Tools:**  `Not available`

**Reference, Class and Method:**

| Reference | Description |
|---|---|
| `COCOM01Y` |  Likely contains common variables and data structures shared across the CardDemo application. |
| `COADM02Y` |  Possibly holds data structures or variables specific to administrative functions within the CardDemo application. |
| `COADM01` |  Appears to define the structure of the screen map (COADM1A) used for the administrative menu. |
| `COTTL01Y` |  Might contain definitions for titles and headings used consistently across the application, including those displayed on the admin menu screen. |
| `CSDAT01Y` |  Likely provides date-related functions or data structures, as the program utilizes date functions. |
| `CSMSG01Y` |  Probably contains message definitions used for displaying messages and errors to the user. |
| `CSUSR01Y` |  May hold data structures related to user information, which could be used for validating user permissions on the admin menu.  |
| `DFHAID` |  A standard CICS copybook providing definitions for system-related fields like transaction identifiers and user IDs. |
| `DFHBMSCA` |  A standard CICS copybook defining the communication area (COMMAREA) used for data exchange between programs. |

| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` |  |

| Method(Public) | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` |  |

| Method(Private) | Description |
|---|---|
| `MAIN-PARA` | This appears to be the main procedure of the program. It handles the initial setup, checks if the program is being re-entered, and then either displays the menu or processes user input.  |
| `PROCESS-ENTER-KEY` | This section processes the user's input when the enter key is pressed. It validates the input and then either displays an error message or transfers control to the selected program. |
| `RETURN-TO-SIGNON-SCREEN` |  This procedure handles the logic for returning the user to the sign-on screen, likely 'COSGN00C'. |
| `SEND-MENU-SCREEN` |  This procedure populates the necessary data for the administrative menu screen and sends it to the user's terminal. |
| `RECEIVE-MENU-SCREEN` | This procedure receives user input from the administrative menu screen.  |
| `POPULATE-HEADER-INFO` | This procedure populates the header information of the screen, such as the current date, time, transaction ID, and program name. |
| `BUILD-MENU-OPTIONS` | This procedure dynamically builds the menu options based on the contents of the `CDEMO-ADMIN-OPT-NUM` and `CDEMO-ADMIN-OPT-NAME` arrays. |
