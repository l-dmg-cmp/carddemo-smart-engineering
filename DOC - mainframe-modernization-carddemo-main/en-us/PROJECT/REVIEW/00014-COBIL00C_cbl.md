**Title:**  Bill Payment (COBOL CICS Program)

**Summary:** 

This COBOL program, `COBIL00C`, handles online bill payments within a CICS environment (likely part of the "CardDemo" application). Its primary function is to process a payment for an account's full balance. It interacts with several data files (VSAM or similar) to retrieve account details, card information, and log transactions. The program manages user interaction through a CICS map-based screen, allowing confirmation before processing the payment.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL
* **Framework/Library:** CICS (Customer Information Control System)
* **Database:**  
    * **VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method - Highly Probable):**  The file interaction patterns (READ, REWRITE, STARTBR, READPREV, ENDBR) strongly suggest VSAM files. 
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`

**Reference, Class and Method:**

| Reference | Description |
|---|---|
| `COCOM01Y` | Likely contains common communication data structures, including `CDEMO-CB00-INFO` for screen navigation and transaction details. |
| `COBIL00` |  Seems to define the layout and data structures for the "Bill Payment" screen, including `COBIL0AO` (output) and `COBIL0AI` (input). |
| `COTTL01Y` |  Potentially holds title and header information for the application's screens. |
| `CSDAT01Y` |  Might contain date-related functions or data structures. |
| `CSMSG01Y` |  Possibly defines standard message formats or variables. |
| `CVACT01Y`, `CVACT03Y` |  Likely related to account management, including `ACCOUNT-RECORD`. |
| `CVTRA05Y` |  Probably defines transaction-related data structures, such as `TRAN-RECORD`. | 
| `DFHAID` | Provides access to CICS system fields, including `EIBAID` for identifying the last key pressed. |
| `DFHBMSCA` |  Gives access to the CICS communication area (`DFHCOMMAREA`). |

| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` |  |

| Method(Public) | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` |  | 

| Method(Private) | Description |
|---|---|
| `MAIN-PARA` | The main program logic. Handles screen navigation, user input validation, data retrieval and update, and transaction processing. |
| `PROCESS-ENTER-KEY` | Processes the user's input when the Enter key is pressed, including data validation and transaction initiation. |
| `GET-CURRENT-TIMESTAMP` | Retrieves and formats the current system timestamp. |
| `RETURN-TO-PREV-SCREEN` |  Handles the logic for returning to the previous screen in the application flow. |
| `SEND-BILLPAY-SCREEN` |  Sends the bill payment screen to the user's terminal. |
| `RECEIVE-BILLPAY-SCREEN` |  Receives user input from the bill payment screen. |
| `POPULATE-HEADER-INFO` |  Populates the header information on the screen. |
| `READ-ACCTDAT-FILE` |  Reads account data from the `ACCTDAT` file. |
| `UPDATE-ACCTDAT-FILE` |  Updates account data in the `ACCTDAT` file. |
| `READ-CXACAIX-FILE` |  Reads data from the `CXACAIX` file (cross-reference file for card and account?). |
| `STARTBR-TRANSACT-FILE` | Starts a browse on the `TRANSACT` file. |
| `READPREV-TRANSACT-FILE` |  Reads the previous record in the `TRANSACT` file. |
| `ENDBR-TRANSACT-FILE` |  Ends the browse on the `TRANSACT` file. |
| `WRITE-TRANSACT-FILE` |  Writes a transaction record to the `TRANSACT` file. |
| `CLEAR-CURRENT-SCREEN` | Clears the data fields on the current screen. |
| `INITIALIZE-ALL-FIELDS` | Initializes data fields to default values. |
