## Technical Analysis Review

**File:**  \src\CBACT02C.cbl

**Title:**  Card Data File Reader and Printer

**Summary:** 

This COBOL program reads and prints the contents of a card data file. It assumes the file is a VSAM KSDS (Key-Sequenced Data Set) and processes each record sequentially. Error handling is implemented to manage file access issues.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL 
* **Framework/Library:** `Not available`
* **Database:**
    * **VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method):**  The code explicitly interacts with a VSAM KSDS file.
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`

**Reference, Class and Method:**

| Reference | Description |
|---|---|
|  `CVACT02Y` | This is a COPY statement, suggesting the inclusion of a separate COBOL source file named "CVACT02Y." This file likely contains data structures or procedures shared across the application. |

| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` | COBOL does not have the concept of classes in the same way as object-oriented languages. |

| Method(Public) | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` | COBOL does not have methods in the same way as object-oriented languages. The program structure is defined by sections (Identification, Environment, Data, Procedure) and paragraphs within the Procedure Division. |

| Method(Private) | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` | COBOL does not have methods in the same way as object-oriented languages.  |
