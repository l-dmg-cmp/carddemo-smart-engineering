## Technical Analysis Review

**File:**  \src\COUSR00C.cbl

**Title:**  User List Program (COBOL - CICS)

**Summary:** 

This COBOL program, `COUSR00C.cbl`, is part of the "CardDemo" application and runs within a CICS environment. It retrieves and displays a list of users from a file named "USRSEC". The program supports pagination (PF7 and PF8 keys) and allows users to select a user for update (U) or delete (D) actions, transferring control to other programs (COUSR02C or COUSR03C) for these operations.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL
* **Framework/Library:** CICS (Customer Information Control System) 
* **Database:**  
   * **VSAM (Likely):**  The file `USRSEC` is likely a VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method) file, a common data storage method on IBM mainframe systems where CICS is typically used. 
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`

**Reference, Class and Method:**

| Reference | Description |
|---|---|
| `COCOM01Y` |  Likely contains a data structure (`CDEMO-CU00-INFO`) related to communication within the CardDemo application, specifically for the CU00 transaction. |
| `COUSR00` | Likely defines the `SEC-USER-DATA` structure representing a record in the USRSEC file, containing user details. |
| `COTTL01Y` |  Probably holds data structures or variables for screen titles and headings. |
| `CSDAT01Y` | Likely provides date-related data structures or variables, as suggested by `WS-CURDATE-DATA`. |
| `CSMSG01Y` |  Probably contains message-related data structures, indicated by the use of `WS-MESSAGE`. | 
| `CSUSR01Y` |  May define user-related data structures, possibly used for user information display. |
| `DFHAID` |  A standard CICS copybook providing symbolic names for CICS function keys (e.g., DFHENTER, DFHPF3). |
| `DFHBMSCA` |  A standard CICS copybook defining the communication area (`DFHCOMMAREA`) used for data exchange between programs. |
