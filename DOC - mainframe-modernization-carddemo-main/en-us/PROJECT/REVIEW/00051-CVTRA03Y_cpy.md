**Title:**  Transaction Type Data Structure

**Summary:** 

This code snippet defines a data structure, likely within a COBOL program, to represent transaction types. It specifies the layout and data types for storing information about each transaction.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL (inferred from `.cpy` extension and code style)
* **Framework/Library:**  `Not available`
* **Database:** `Not available` 
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`

**Reference, Class and Method:**

 **Data Structure Analysis:**

* **`TRAN-TYPE-RECORD`:**
    * Likely the name of the record structure holding transaction type information.
    * Indicated length: 60 characters (from the header comment).
* **`TRAN-TYPE`:**
    * A 2-character field (`PIC X(02)`) likely storing a code or abbreviation for the transaction type (e.g., "SA" for Sale, "RT" for Return).
* **`TRAN-TYPE-DESC`:**
    * A 50-character field (`PIC X(50)`) intended for a human-readable description of the transaction type (e.g., "Sales Transaction," "Customer Return").
* **`FILLER`:** 
    * An 8-character filler field (`PIC X(08)`).  Fillers are often used for padding or alignment within fixed-length record structures.

**Additional Notes:**

* **Version Control:** The comment `Ver: CardDemo_v1.0-15-g27d6c6f-68 Date: 2022-07-19 23:16:00 CDT` suggests a version control system is in place, tracking changes to the codebase.
* **Possible Context:** The name "CardDemo" in the version control comment hints that this code might be part of a point-of-sale (POS) or card transaction processing system.
