**Title:**  COBOL Data Structure for User Information (Likely Screen or Report)

**Summary:** 

This COBOL code defines two data structures, `COUSR0AI` and `COUSR0AO`, likely representing input and output areas for a user-related screen or report. It includes fields for user IDs, names, user types, selection flags, as well as system-related information like transaction name, program name, date, time, and page number. The `REDEFINES` clause suggests a mechanism to handle both display and computational aspects of the data.
