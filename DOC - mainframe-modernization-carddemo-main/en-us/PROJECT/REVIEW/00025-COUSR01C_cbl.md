## Technical Analysis Review

**File:**  \src\COUSR01C.cbl

**Title:**  Add New User (COBOL CICS Program)

**Summary:** 

This COBOL program, `COUSR01C`, is a CICS online transaction processing program designed to add new users to a system. Users can be designated as either "Regular" or "Admin". The program handles user input validation, interacts with a user security file (`USRSEC`), and provides feedback messages to the user through a CICS map-based interface. 

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL
* **Framework/Library:** CICS (Customer Information Control System) for transaction management and screen handling. 
* **Database:**
  * **VSAM (Likely):** The code interacts with a file named `USRSEC`, which is highly suggestive of a VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method) file, a common data storage mechanism on IBM mainframe systems. 
* **Others Tools:**
    * **DFHCOMMAREA:** CICS communication area for passing data between programs.
    * **Maps and Mapsets:**  CICS uses maps (`COUSR1A`) and mapsets (`COUSR01`) to define screen layouts and handle user input/output.

**Reference, Class and Method:**

| Reference | Description |
|---|---|
| `COCOM01Y` | Likely contains common constants and variables shared across the application. |
| `COUSR01` |  Likely defines the layout and fields for the screen (map) used for user input. |
| `COTTL01Y` |  Possibly defines common title or header information for screens. |
| `CSDAT01Y` |  Likely contains date-related functions or data structures. |
| `CSMSG01Y` |  Probably defines message constants or handling routines. |
| `CSUSR01Y` |  May define user-related data structures or functions. |
| `DFHAID` | Provides symbolic names for CICS attention identifier (AID) values, such as `DFHENTER` (Enter key), `DFHPF3`, etc. |
| `DFHBMSCA` |  Defines the structure of the CICS Basic Mapping Support (BMS) control area (BCA), used for communication between the program and the CICS mapping facilities. |
| `DFHATTR` |  (Commented out) - If used, would define symbolic names for BMS attribute bytes, controlling the display characteristics of screen fields. |

| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` |  |

| Method(Public) | Description |
|---|---|
| `MAIN-PARA` | The main entry point of the COBOL program. It controls the overall program flow. |
| `PROCESS-ENTER-KEY` |  Handles the logic when the user presses the Enter key, including data validation and writing the new user record to the `USRSEC` file. |
| `RETURN-TO-PREV-SCREEN` |  Manages the transfer of control back to the previous screen in the application. |
| `SEND-USRADD-SCREEN` |  Sends the user input screen (`COUSR1A` in the `COUSR01` mapset) to the user's terminal. |
| `RECEIVE-USRADD-SCREEN` |  Receives user input from the screen (`COUSR1A`). |
| `POPULATE-HEADER-INFO` |  Populates header information on the screen, including the current date, time, transaction ID, and program name. |
| `WRITE-USER-SEC-FILE` |  Writes the new user record to the `USRSEC` file. |
| `CLEAR-CURRENT-SCREEN` | Clears the input fields on the current screen. |
| `INITIALIZE-ALL-FIELDS` |  Initializes data fields to their default values. |

| Method(Private) | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` |  |
