## Technical Analysis Review

**File:**  \src\COUSR01.CPY

**Title:**  User Information Copybook (COUSR01)

**Summary:** 

This COBOL copybook defines two data structures, `COUSR1AI` and `COUSR1AO`, likely representing user information for a system.  The structures appear to hold fields for:

* Transaction and Program details (names, titles, dates, times)
* User details (first name, last name, user ID, password, user type)
* Error message storage

The use of redefined structures (`COUSR1AO` redefines `COUSR1AI`) suggests different ways to access and interpret the same data, potentially for display or communication purposes.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL 
* **Framework/Library:** `Not available`
* **Database:**  While there are no explicit database references, the data structure's naming conventions and content (user IDs, passwords) strongly suggest its use within a system that manages user data, likely backed by a database.
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`
