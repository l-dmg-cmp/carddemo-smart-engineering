## Technical Analysis Review

**File:**  \src\CBCUS01C.cbl

**Title:**  Customer Data File Processor (CBCUS01C)

**Summary:** 

This COBOL program sequentially reads and displays customer records from a VSAM KSDS (Key-Sequenced Data Set) file named `CUSTFILE`. It includes error handling for file operations (open, read, close) and utilizes a copybook (`CVCUS01Y`) for shared data structures.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL
* **Framework/Library:** `Not available`
* **Database:**
  * **VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method):**  The code interacts with a VSAM KSDS file (`CUSTFILE`) for persistent storage of customer data.
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`

**Reference, Class and Method:**

| Reference | Description |
|---|---|
|  `CVCUS01Y` |  A COBOL copybook likely containing the definition of the `CUSTOMER-RECORD` data structure. This structure holds details about a customer, but its specific fields are not defined within the provided code snippet. |

| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` |  |

| Method(Public) | Description |
|---|---|
| `1000-CUSTFILE-GET-NEXT` | Reads the next customer record from `CUSTFILE` and performs error handling based on file status codes. If a record is successfully read, it populates the `CUSTOMER-RECORD` variable and sets appropriate application status flags.  |
| `0000-CUSTFILE-OPEN` | Opens the `CUSTFILE` for input and checks for successful file opening. In case of errors, it displays an error message, sets status flags, and potentially terminates the program.  |
| `9000-CUSTFILE-CLOSE` |  Closes the `CUSTFILE` and checks for successful closure. Similar to the open routine, it handles potential errors by displaying messages, setting status flags, and possibly terminating the program.  |
| `Z-ABEND-PROGRAM` |  A procedure designed to abnormally terminate the program. It displays an "ABENDING PROGRAM" message, sets specific codes for timing and abend reason (`ABCODE`), and then calls the IBM Language Environment abend function (`CEE3ABD`) to trigger the abend.  |
| `Z-DISPLAY-IO-STATUS` |  Formats and displays the file status code (`IO-STATUS`) in a user-friendly manner. It handles both numeric and non-numeric status codes, converting them to a four-digit format for display. |

| Method(Private) | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` |  |
