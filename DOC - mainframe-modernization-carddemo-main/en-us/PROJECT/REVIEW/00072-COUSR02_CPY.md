**Title:**  COBOL Copybook for User Information (COUSR2)

**Summary:** 

This COBOL copybook defines two data structures, `COUSR2AI` and `COUSR2AO`, likely representing user-related information.  The structures appear to be designed for interaction with a system that uses both ASCII and EBCDIC character encodings, as suggested by the presence of fields with suffixes like "C," "P," "H," "V," and "O," potentially standing for different data representations.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL
* **Framework/Library:** `Not available`
* **Database:** `Not available`
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`

**Reference, Class and Method:**

 **Notes:**
* The use of `REDEFINES` suggests the data can be interpreted in multiple ways, potentially for handling different data formats or conversions.
* The naming conventions (e.g., `*L` for length, `*F` for flag, `*A` for ASCII) provide hints about the purpose of individual fields.
* Without further context or accompanying programs, it's challenging to determine the exact usage of many fields.
