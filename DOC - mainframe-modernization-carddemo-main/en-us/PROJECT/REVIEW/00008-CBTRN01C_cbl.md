## Technical Analysis Review

**File:**  \src\CBTRN01C.cbl

**Title:**  Card Transaction Posting (CBTRN01C)

**Summary:** 

This COBOL program processes daily card transactions from a sequential file (DALYTRAN). It performs lookups against indexed files for customer (CUSTOMER-FILE), card-account cross-reference (XREF-FILE), card details (CARD-FILE), account details (ACCOUNT-FILE), and transactions (TRANSACT-FILE).  The program appears to validate card numbers, retrieve account information, and likely updates transaction records. However, the exact update logic is not present in the provided code snippet.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL
* **Framework/Library:**  `Not available` 
* **Database:**
  * **Not Specified:**  The specific database system is not explicitly mentioned in the code. The file organization clauses (SEQUENTIAL, INDEXED) suggest standard file system interactions or a possible ISAM (Indexed Sequential Access Method) database.
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`
