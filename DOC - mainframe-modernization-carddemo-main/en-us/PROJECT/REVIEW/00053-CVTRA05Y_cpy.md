**Title:**  Transaction Record Data Structure 

**Summary:** 

This code defines a data structure, likely within a COBOL program, to represent a transaction record. It specifies the layout, data types, and sizes of fields used to store information about financial transactions.  

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:**  COBOL (inferred from `.cpy` extension and syntax)
* **Framework/Library:**  Not applicable (COBOL typically doesn't use external frameworks in this way).
* **Database:**  While not explicitly stated, the structure suggests potential interaction with a database system, as it defines a record layout commonly used for storing data.
