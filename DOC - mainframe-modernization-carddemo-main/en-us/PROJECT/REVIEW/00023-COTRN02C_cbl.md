## Technical Analysis Review

**File:**  \src\COTRN02C.cbl

**Title:**  Add New Transaction

**Summary:** 

This CICS COBOL program, `COTRN02C`, is part of the CardDemo application. Its primary function is to add new transaction records to the TRANSACT file. The program interacts with various data files (TRANSACT, ACCTDAT, CCXREF, CXACAIX), validates user input from a screen (COTRN2A), and utilizes CICS commands for screen navigation, data retrieval, and transaction management.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL
* **Framework/Library:** CICS (Customer Information Control System)
* **Database:**  The specific database system is not explicitly mentioned in the code. However, the use of VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method) file access methods like `STARTBR`, `READPREV`, `ENDBR`, and `WRITE` suggest interaction with a VSAM-based data store.
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`

**Reference, Class and Method:**

| Reference | Description |
|---|---|
| `COCOM01Y` | Contains the definition of `CDEMO-CT02-INFO` structure, likely holding information related to transaction selection and pagination. |
| `COTRN02` |  Likely defines the structure `COTRN2AI` and `COTRN2AO`, which represent the input and output areas for the 'COTRN2A' map used in the screen interaction. |
| `COTTL01Y` |  Potentially contains the definition for common titles and labels used across the CardDemo application. |
| `CSDAT01Y` |  Likely holds data structures related to date manipulation or validation, including `WS-CURDATE-DATA`. |
| `CSMSG01Y` | Probably defines structures or variables used for message handling, such as `ERRMSGO` and `ERRMSGC`. |
| `CVTRA05Y` | Might contain the layout for the `TRAN-RECORD` structure, representing a record in the TRANSACT file. |
| `CVACT01Y` | Could define structures related to account information, possibly used for validating account IDs.  |
| `CVACT03Y` | Might hold the layout for the `CARD-XREF-RECORD` structure, likely used for cross-referencing card numbers and account IDs. |
| `DFHAID` | Provides definitions for standard CICS system fields, including `EIBAID` used for identifying the type of terminal input. |
| `DFHBMSCA` | Contains definitions for the `DFHCOMMAREA` structure, used for communication between CICS programs. |

| `Not available` |  |

| Method(Public) | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` |  |

| Method(Private) | Description |
|---|---|
| `MAIN-PARA` | The main procedure of the program, orchestrating the flow of execution. |
| `PROCESS-ENTER-KEY` | Handles the processing when the Enter key is pressed, triggering input validation and potentially the `ADD-TRANSACTION` routine. |
| `VALIDATE-INPUT-KEY-FIELDS` | Validates the key fields entered by the user, such as Account ID and Card Number. |
| `VALIDATE-INPUT-DATA-FIELDS` | Performs data validation on the input fields of the transaction, ensuring data integrity. |
| `ADD-TRANSACTION` | Adds a new transaction record to the TRANSACT file based on validated user input. |
| `COPY-LAST-TRAN-DATA` | Copies data from the last transaction, streamlining data entry for similar transactions. |
| `RETURN-TO-PREV-SCREEN` | Navigates back to the previous screen in the CICS application flow. |
| `SEND-TRNADD-SCREEN` | Sends the transaction add screen (COTRN2A) to the user's terminal. |
| `RECEIVE-TRNADD-SCREEN` | Receives data entered by the user on the transaction add screen. |
| `POPULATE-HEADER-INFO` | Populates header information, such as date, time, and program details, on the screen. |
| `READ-CXACAIX-FILE` | Reads data from the CXACAIX file based on the provided account ID. |
| `READ-CCXREF-FILE` | Reads data from the CCXREF file using the provided card number. |
| `STARTBR-TRANSACT-FILE` | Sets up a browse operation on the TRANSACT file for fetching the last transaction ID. |
| `READPREV-TRANSACT-FILE` | Reads the previous record during the browse operation on the TRANSACT file. |
| `ENDBR-TRANSACT-FILE` | Ends the browse operation on the TRANSACT file. |
| `WRITE-TRANSACT-FILE` | Writes the new transaction record to the TRANSACT file. |
| `CLEAR-CURRENT-SCREEN` | Clears the input fields on the current screen. |
| `INITIALIZE-ALL-FIELDS` | Initializes and resets all input fields on the screen to their default values. |
