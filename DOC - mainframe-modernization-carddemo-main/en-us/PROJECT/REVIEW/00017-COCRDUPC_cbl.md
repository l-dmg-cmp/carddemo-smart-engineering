## Technical Analysis Review

**File:**  \src\COCRDUPC.cbl

**Title:**  Credit Card Detail Update Program

**Summary:** 

This COBOL program provides a CICS online interface for updating credit card details. It interacts with a Card Data File (likely VSAM or similar), allowing users to retrieve, modify, and save card information. The program emphasizes data validation and includes robust error handling.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL
* **Framework/Library:** CICS (Customer Information Control System)
* **Database:**
  * While the specific database system is not explicitly named, the program references a "Card Data File" accessed through CICS file control commands (READ, REWRITE).  This suggests a hierarchical or network database commonly used with CICS, such as VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method). 
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`

**Reference, Class and Method:**

| Reference | Description |
|---|---|
| `CVCRD01Y` |  Likely a copybook containing definitions for credit card-related data structures or constants. |
| `COCOM01Y` |  Appears to be a copybook defining the structure of a common communication area (COMMAREA) used for data exchange between programs. |
| `COTTL01Y` | Likely includes definitions for screen titles used across the application. |
| `COCRDUP` |  Probably contains the screen layout definition (maps) for the credit card update screen. |
| `CSDAT01Y` |  Likely provides date-related routines or data structures for handling dates. |
| `CSMSG01Y` |  Presumably a copybook containing common message definitions used for displaying information or errors. |
| `CSMSG02Y` |  Likely defines variables or structures related to abend (abnormal end) handling. |
| `CSUSR01Y` |  Probably contains data structures or variables related to signed-on user information. |
| `CVACT02Y` |  Defines the layout of the "CARD RECORD" used for reading from and writing to the Card Data File. |
| `CVCUS01Y` | Likely contains the layout or data structure for customer-related information. |
| `DFHBMSCA` |  A standard CICS copybook providing definitions for the symbolic map input/output areas (DFHCOMMAREA). |
| `DFHAID` |  A standard CICS copybook defining the EXEC interface block (EIB) for accessing CICS control information. |
| `CSSTRPFY` |  A custom or potentially library copybook (indicated by ' ') that likely contains a routine for storing or handling PF (Program Function) keys. |
