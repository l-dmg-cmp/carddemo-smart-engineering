## Technical Analysis Review

**File:**  \src\CBACT03C.cbl

**Title:**  Card Account Cross Reference Data File Processor

**Summary:** 

This COBOL program sequentially reads and displays records from an indexed file (likely VSAM) containing card account cross-reference data. It handles file status codes for common I/O operations and includes error handling with abend procedures.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL 
* **Framework/Library:**  `Not available`
* **Database:**
  * **VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method):**  Highly likely, given the use of indexed file organization and the `SELECT ASSIGN` clause structure, which are strong indicators of VSAM datasets in COBOL.
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`
