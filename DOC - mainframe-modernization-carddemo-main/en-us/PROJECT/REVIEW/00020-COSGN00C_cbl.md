## Technical Analysis Review

**File:**  \COSGN00C.cbl

**Title:**  CardDemo Signon Screen

**Summary:** 

This is a CICS COBOL program that presents a signon screen for the CardDemo application. It handles user authentication by validating credentials against a user security file (USRSEC) and then transfers control to different parts of the application based on user type. 

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL
* **Framework/Library:**  CICS (Customer Information Control System) 
* **Database:**
    *  **VSAM (likely):**  The code interacts with a file named "USRSEC," suggesting the use of VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method), a common file access method on IBM mainframe systems. 
* **Others Tools:** `Not available` 

**Reference, Class and Method:**

| Reference | Description |
|---|---|
| `COCOM01Y` | Likely contains definitions for common variables or data structures used across the CardDemo application. |

| `COTTL01Y` | Likely contains title information or messages related to the application. |
| `CSDAT01Y` | Probably contains date-related data structures or variables. |
| `CSMSG01Y` | Likely contains message definitions used by the application. |
| `CSUSR01Y` | Possibly contains user-related data structures or variables. |
| `DFHAID`   | Provides access to CICS system information and control areas. |
| `DFHBMSCA` |  Provides access to the CICS Terminal Control Block (TCB), containing information about the user's terminal session. |
| `DFHATTR`  |  Commented out but indicates the potential use of dynamic screen attributes. |
