## Technical Analysis Review

**File:**  \src\COTRN00C.cbl

**Title:**  Transaction Listing Program 

**Summary:** 

This COBOL program, `COTRN00C`, is part of the `CardDemo` application. Its primary function is to retrieve and display a list of transactions from a file named `TRANSACT`. The program interacts with a CICS environment for screen handling and data access. It allows users to navigate through pages of transaction records, providing options for forward and backward movement. There's an indication of transaction selection functionality, but the specific action taken upon selection isn't fully clear from the provided code. 

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL 
* **Framework/Library:** CICS (Customer Information Control System)
* **Database:**  VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method) - *Inferred from the CICS context, the `TRANSACT` file is likely a VSAM file*.
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`

**Reference, Class and Method:**

| Reference | Description |
|---|---|
| `COCOM01Y` |  Likely contains common communication area definitions for the CardDemo application. |
| `COTRN00` |  Likely defines the structure of the `TRAN-RECORD`, used to store individual transaction details. |
| `COTTL01Y` |  Potentially contains definitions for titles and labels used in the program's output. |
| `CSDAT01Y` |  Likely provides date-related data structures and variables. |
| `CSMSG01Y` |  Probably contains message-related definitions used for displaying information or errors to the user. |
| `CVTRA05Y` |  Possibly related to transaction processing or variable definitions for transactions. | 
| `DFHAID` |  Provides definitions for CICS system fields, including `EIBAID` for identifying the last function key pressed. | 
| `DFHBMSCA` |  Defines the structure of the CICS communication area (`DFHCOMMAREA`). | 

| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` |  |

| Method(Public) | Description |
|---|---|
| `MAIN-PARA` |  The main entry point of the program.  Handles initialization, screen interaction, and program flow based on user input. |
| `PROCESS-ENTER-KEY` |  Processes actions when the Enter key is pressed.  Determines if a transaction is selected and potentially navigates to a detailed transaction view. |
| `PROCESS-PF7-KEY` |  Handles actions when the PF7 function key (Page Up) is pressed. Navigates to the previous page of transactions. |
| `PROCESS-PF8-KEY` |  Handles actions when the PF8 function key (Page Down) is pressed. Navigates to the next page of transactions. |
| `PROCESS-PAGE-FORWARD` |  Manages the logic for moving to the next page of transactions, including reading records from the `TRANSACT` file and populating screen fields. |
| `PROCESS-PAGE-BACKWARD` |  Handles moving to the previous page of transactions, including reading records and updating screen elements. |
| `POPULATE-TRAN-DATA` |  Fills the screen fields with data from the current `TRAN-RECORD`. |
| `INITIALIZE-TRAN-DATA` |  Clears the transaction data fields on the screen, preparing for the display of a new set of records. |
| `RETURN-TO-PREV-SCREEN` |  Navigates back to the previous screen in the application. |
| `SEND-TRNLST-SCREEN` |  Sends the transaction listing screen (`COTRN0A`) to the user, displaying the retrieved transaction data. |
| `RECEIVE-TRNLST-SCREEN` |  Receives input from the transaction listing screen, including user selections and function key presses. |
| `POPULATE-HEADER-INFO` |  Populates the header information on the screen, such as the program name, transaction ID, and current date and time. |
| `STARTBR-TRANSACT-FILE` |  Initiates a browse (read) operation on the `TRANSACT` file.  Sets up the file for sequential reading. |
| `READNEXT-TRANSACT-FILE` |  Reads the next record from the `TRANSACT` file. |
| `READPREV-TRANSACT-FILE` |  Reads the previous record from the `TRANSACT` file. |
| `ENDBR-TRANSACT-FILE` |  Terminates the browse operation on the `TRANSACT` file. |

| Method(Private) | Description |
