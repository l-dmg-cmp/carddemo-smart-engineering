**Title:**  Date Validation Procedures 

**Summary:** 

This COBOL copybook (CSUTLDPY.cpy) provides a set of reusable procedures designed for validating dates in the format CCYYMMDD.  It includes checks for valid century, year, month, and day combinations, ensuring dates are logical and reasonable (e.g., not in the future for birthdates). The code relies heavily on structured programming principles with well-defined entry and exit points for each validation routine. 

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL
* **Framework/Library:**  `Not available`
* **Database:**  While the code itself doesn't directly interact with a database, it mentions the use of "Oracle 9" in a comment, suggesting the larger system this copybook is part of likely uses an Oracle 9 database.
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`

| Method(Public) | Description |
|---|---|
| `EDIT-DATE-CCYYMMDD` |  Main procedure to validate a date in CCYYMMDD format.  Calls sub-procedures for year, month, and day validation, and performs a final leap year check. Sets various flags in the `WS-` working storage area based on the validation outcome.  |
| `EDIT-YEAR-CCYY` |  Validates the year portion (CCYY) of the date. Checks if the year is supplied, numeric, and within a reasonable century (19xx or 20xx).  |
| `EDIT-MONTH` |  Validates the month portion (MM) of the date. Ensures the month is supplied, numeric, and within the range of 1 to 12. |
| `EDIT-DAY` |  Validates the day portion (DD) of the date. Checks if the day is supplied, numeric, and falls within a valid range for the given month.  |
| `EDIT-DAY-MONTH-YEAR` | This procedure performs additional checks on the day, month, and year combination to ensure consistency, particularly focusing on the number of days in a month and leap year validation.  |
| `EDIT-DATE-LE` |  Appears to use an external service or function (`CSUTLDTC`) to perform additional date validation.  The exact nature of this service is not clear from the provided code. |
| `EDIT-DATE-OF-BIRTH` |  Validates if a date is a reasonable date of birth by checking if it's in the future.  Uses the `CURRENT-DATE` function to get the current system date. |
