## Technical Analysis Review

**File:**  \src\COMEN01C.cbl

**Title:**  Main Menu for Regular Users (CardDemo Application)

**Summary:** 

This COBOL program (`COMEN01C`) presents a menu-driven interface for regular users within the CardDemo application. It handles user input (menu selections), basic validation, and program navigation based on the chosen option. The program interacts with CICS for screen handling and program control.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL
* **Framework/Library:** CICS (Customer Information Control System)
* **Database:**  While the code doesn't directly interact with a database within this file, it references data structures (`WS-USRSEC-FILE`) suggesting potential database operations handled by other programs or modules.
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`

**Reference, Class and Method:**

| Reference | Description |
|---|---|
| `COCOM01Y` | Likely contains common communication area definitions used across the CardDemo application. |
| `COMEN02Y` | Potentially holds data structures or variables related to another menu screen or functionality within the menu system. |
| `COMEN01` |  Appears to define the layout and data fields for the menu screen (COMEN1A) displayed to the user. |
| `COTTL01Y` |  Could contain definitions for titles and headings used consistently across screens in the application. |
| `CSDAT01Y` |  Likely provides data structures or variables for handling dates within the application. |
| `CSMSG01Y` | Probably defines message-related data structures or variables for displaying messages to the user. |
| `CSUSR01Y` | Might contain user-related data structures or variables, such as user information and security attributes. |
| `DFHAID` |  Provides access to CICS system information and communication areas, including the Execute Interface Block (EIB).  |
| `DFHBMSCA` | Defines the structure of the DFHCOMMAREA, a communication area used for data exchange between CICS programs. |


| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` |  |

| Method(Public) | Description |
|---|---|
| `MAIN-PARA` | The main entry point of the program. It initializes variables, handles communication with other programs, processes user input, and controls program flow. |
| `PROCESS-ENTER-KEY` |  Handles the user pressing the Enter key. It validates the entered option, checks user authorization, and transfers control to the selected program if valid. |
| `RETURN-TO-SIGNON-SCREEN` |  Returns control to the sign-on screen (COSGN00C). |
| `SEND-MENU-SCREEN` |  Sends the menu screen (COMEN1A) to the user, displaying the menu options and any messages. |
| `RECEIVE-MENU-SCREEN` |  Receives user input from the menu screen (COMEN1A). |
| `POPULATE-HEADER-INFO` | Populates the header information of the menu screen, including titles, program name, date, and time. |
| `BUILD-MENU-OPTIONS` |  Dynamically constructs the menu options based on the configured options and displays them on the screen. |


| Method(Private) | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` |  |
