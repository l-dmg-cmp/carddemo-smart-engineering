## Technical Analysis Review

**File:**  \src\COUSR02C.cbl

**Title:**  CICS COBOL Program for User Update (USRSEC File)

**Summary:** 

This CICS COBOL program, `COUSR02C`, is part of the `CardDemo` application. It's designed to handle the update of user information within a file named `USRSEC`. The program interacts with CICS for transaction management and screen handling. It receives user input from a screen (likely `COUSR2A` in a mapset `COUSR02`), validates the input, reads and updates the `USRSEC` file, and sends responses back to the user.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL
* **Framework/Library:** CICS (Customer Information Control System)
* **Database:**  
   * **VSAM (likely):** The code interacts with a file named `USRSEC`. Given the context of CICS and COBOL, it's highly probable that `USRSEC` is a VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method) file, a common file system used in IBM mainframe environments. 
* **Others Tools:** `Not available` 

**Reference, Class and Method:**

| Reference | Description |
|---|---|
| `COCOM01Y` | Likely contains a data structure (`CDEMO-CU02-INFO`) related to the `CardDemo` application, specifically for the transaction `CU02` (inferred from variable names). |
| `COUSR02` |  Likely contains a data structure related to user information, potentially the layout for the `USRSEC` file. |
| `COTTL01Y` |  Potentially contains data structures or variables for handling titles or labels within the application. |
| `CSDAT01Y` | Likely contains data structures or variables related to date manipulation. |
| `CSMSG01Y` |  Probably holds data structures or variables for managing messages displayed to the user.  |
| `CSUSR01Y` |  Might contain data structures or variables related to user-specific information or processing. |
| `DFHAID` |  Provides definitions for CICS system constants related to Attention Identifiers (AIDs), used for handling special keys like PF keys. |
| `DFHBMSCA` | Provides definitions for CICS system constants, including common return codes and status values. |

| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` |  |

| Method(Public) | Description |
|---|---|
| `MAIN-PARA` | The main procedure of the program. It controls the overall flow, handles user input, and interacts with other procedures. | 
| `PROCESS-ENTER-KEY` |  Handles the logic when the user presses the Enter key. It validates the input `USRIDINI` (User ID) and reads user data from the `USRSEC` file. |
| `UPDATE-USER-INFO` |  Manages the update process. It performs input validation, checks for modifications, updates the `USRSEC` file, and displays appropriate messages. |
| `RETURN-TO-PREV-SCREEN` |  Handles the logic to return to the previous screen in the application flow. |
| `SEND-USRUPD-SCREEN` |  Sends the screen `COUSR2A` (from mapset `COUSR02`) to the user, displaying the content of `COUSR2AO`. |
| `RECEIVE-USRUPD-SCREEN` |  Receives user input from the screen `COUSR2A` (mapset `COUSR02`) and stores it in `COUSR2AI`. |
| `POPULATE-HEADER-INFO` |  Populates header information on the screen, including titles, transaction name, program name, date, and time. |
| `READ-USER-SEC-FILE` |  Reads user data from the `USRSEC` file based on the provided `SEC-USR-ID`. |
| `UPDATE-USER-SEC-FILE` |  Updates the `USRSEC` file with the modified user data. |
| `CLEAR-CURRENT-SCREEN` |  Clears the current screen and initializes the input fields. |
| `INITIALIZE-ALL-FIELDS` |  Initializes all input fields to their default values. |

| Method(Private) | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` |  |
