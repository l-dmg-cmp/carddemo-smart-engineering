## Technical Analysis Review

**File:**  \src\COTRN01C.cbl

**Title:**  View Transaction Detail 

**Summary:** 

This CICS COBOL program, `COTRN01C`, is part of the `CardDemo` application. Its primary function is to retrieve and display details of a specific transaction from a file named `TRANSACT`.  The program interacts with a user through a screen (likely using CICS BMS maps) to receive a transaction ID, fetches the corresponding transaction data, and presents it to the user.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL
* **Framework/Library:** CICS (Customer Information Control System) 
* **Database:**  
    * **VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method):**  While not directly stated, the use of `DATASET` and `RIDFLD` within the `EXEC CICS READ` command strongly suggests the `TRANSACT` file is a VSAM file.
* **Others Tools:** 
    * **BMS (Basic Mapping Support):** Inferred from the use of `EXEC CICS SEND` and `EXEC CICS RECEIVE` commands with `MAP` and `MAPSET` options. This indicates the program interacts with screens defined using CICS BMS maps.

**Reference, Class and Method:**

| Reference | Description |
|---|---|
| `COCOM01Y` | Likely contains shared data structures or variables used across the `CardDemo` application, including fields related to program navigation and communication (`CDEMO-TO-PROGRAM`, `CDEMO-FROM-PROGRAM`, etc.).  |
| `COTRN01` |  Probably defines the layout of the `TRAN-RECORD` structure, which maps to the data stored in the `TRANSACT` file. |
| `COTTL01Y` |  May contain definitions related to titles or labels displayed on screens, as suggested by the variable `CCDA-TITLE01`. |
| `CSDAT01Y` |  Likely provides date-related data structures or variables. The use of `WS-CURDATE-DATA` suggests it might hold components for year, month, and day. |
| `CSMSG01Y` |  Probably defines message-related variables, indicated by the use of `ERRMSGO`. |
| `CVTRA05Y` |  The purpose of this copybook is unclear without further context.  |
| `DFHAID` |  A standard CICS copybook providing definitions for system-related fields, including `EIBAID` (used for capturing user actions like function keys). |
| `DFHBMSCA` | A standard CICS copybook that defines the `DFHCOMMAREA` data structure, used for communication between programs within a CICS environment. |

| Method(Public) | Description |
|---|---|
| `MAIN-PARA` | The main entry point of the COBOL program. It controls the overall flow and logic, handling user input, data retrieval, and screen interactions. |
| `PROCESS-ENTER-KEY` |  Triggered when the user presses the Enter key. It validates the input transaction ID, reads transaction details from the `TRANSACT` file, and prepares data for display. |
| `RETURN-TO-PREV-SCREEN` |  Handles navigation back to the previous screen in the application flow. |
| `SEND-TRNVIEW-SCREEN` |  Sends the transaction details to the screen for display using a CICS SEND command. |
| `RECEIVE-TRNVIEW-SCREEN` |  Receives user input and actions from the screen using a CICS RECEIVE command. |
| `POPULATE-HEADER-INFO` |  Populates header information on the screen, such as program name, date, and time. |
| `READ-TRANSACT-FILE` |  Reads a transaction record from the `TRANSACT` file based on the provided transaction ID. |
| `CLEAR-CURRENT-SCREEN` |  Clears the input fields on the current screen. |
| `INITIALIZE-ALL-FIELDS` |  Initializes data fields to their default values. |
