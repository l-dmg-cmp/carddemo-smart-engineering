**Title:**  COBOL Working Storage and Data Definitions (Likely Part of a Larger Program)

**Summary:** 

This code snippet appears to be a fragment from a COBOL program's Working-Storage Section, defining data items and their initial values. These data items likely hold information related to credit cards, user interface interactions (like function keys), and program flow control. 

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL (GnuCOBOL is a possibility, given the comment style)
* **Framework/Library:**  Not applicable (COBOL typically relies on intrinsic functions and doesn't use frameworks in the same way as modern languages).
* **Database:**
  * **Potentially Accessed via COBOL File I/O:**  While no database is directly referenced, COBOL programs often interact with databases using file input/output operations.
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`
