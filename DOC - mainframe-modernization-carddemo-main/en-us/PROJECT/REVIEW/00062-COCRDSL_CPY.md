## Technical Analysis Review

**File:**  \COCRDSL.CPY

**Title:**  Common Card Reader Data Structure Layout

**Summary:** 

This code defines data structures (`COCRDSLAI` and `COCRDSLAO`) used for storing and exchanging information related to credit card transactions.  It appears to be designed for a system that interacts with card readers and handles data such as card numbers, expiration dates, and transaction details.  The use of two structures, one with individual data fields and another with redefined fields for color attributes, suggests a display or terminal-based interface where visual cues might be important.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:**  COBOL (indicated by the file extension ".CPY" and the characteristic syntax)
* **Framework/Library:** `Not available`
* **Database:**  While the code itself doesn't specify a database, it likely interacts with a database to store and retrieve card and transaction information. 
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`

**Reference, Class and Method:**

| Reference | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` | |

| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` |  COBOL uses a different structure than classes. It defines data structures using levels (01, 02, etc.) and PICTURE clauses. |

| Method(Public) | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` | COBOL doesn't have the concept of methods in the same way as object-oriented languages. Logic and operations on data structures are typically handled within procedures or paragraphs.  |

| Method(Private) | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` | COBOL doesn't have the concept of methods in the same way as object-oriented languages. Logic and operations on data structures are typically handled within procedures or paragraphs.  |
