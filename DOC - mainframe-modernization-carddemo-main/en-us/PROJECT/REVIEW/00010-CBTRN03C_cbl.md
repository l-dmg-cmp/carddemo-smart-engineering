**Title:**  Transaction Detail Report Generator

**Summary:** 

This COBOL program generates a detailed transaction report from transaction data. It reads transaction records, retrieves related data from indexed files (card cross-reference, transaction type, transaction category), and formats the information into a report. The report includes page totals, account totals, and a grand total for the specified date range.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL 
* **Framework/Library:** `Not available`
* **Database:**
  * **VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method):**  The program interacts with VSAM data sets for storing and retrieving data.  This is evident from the comments and file organization clauses.
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`
