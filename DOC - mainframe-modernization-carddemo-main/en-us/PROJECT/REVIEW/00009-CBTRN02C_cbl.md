## Technical Analysis Review

**File:**  \src\CBTRN02C.cbl

**Title:**  Transaction Posting Batch Process

**Summary:** 

This COBOL program processes daily transactions from a sequential file (`DALYTRAN-FILE`), performing validations against cross-reference and account data before updating transaction and account balances in indexed files. Rejected transactions are written to a separate file (`DALYREJS-FILE`) with reason codes.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL 
* **Framework/Library:** `Not available`
* **Database:**
    * **DB2 (Assumed):** The program uses a timestamp format (`DB2-FORMAT-TS`) and constructs it in a manner typical for DB2 databases. This suggests interaction with DB2, although not explicitly stated. 
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`
