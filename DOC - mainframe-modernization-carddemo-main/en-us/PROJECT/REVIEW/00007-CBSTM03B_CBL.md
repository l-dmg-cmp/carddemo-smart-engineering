**Title:**  Card Transaction File Processor (Subroutine)

**Summary:** 

This COBOL subroutine manages file operations (open, read, close) for four indexed files related to card transactions, acting as a reusable component within a larger batch processing system. It handles reading transaction records, cross-referencing card information, and accessing customer and account details.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL 
* **Framework/Library:** `Not available`
* **Database:**  While the specific database system is not explicitly named, the code structure suggests interaction with an indexed file system, likely managed by the operating system or a transactional system. The use of `SELECT ASSIGN TO` clauses implies external file definitions.
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`

| `1999-EXIT` | Exits the `1000-TRNXFILE-PROC` section. |
| `2000-XREFFILE-PROC` | Processes operations (open, read, close) for the `XREF-FILE`. |
| `2900-EXIT` | Sets the return code based on the file status of `XREF-FILE` and branches to the end of the `2000-XREFFILE-PROC` section. |
| `2999-EXIT` | Exits the `2000-XREFFILE-PROC` section. |
| `3000-CUSTFILE-PROC` | Processes operations (open, read, close) for the `CUST-FILE`. |
| `3900-EXIT` | Sets the return code based on the file status of `CUST-FILE` and branches to the end of the `3000-CUSTFILE-PROC` section. |
| `3999-EXIT` | Exits the `3000-CUSTFILE-PROC` section. |
| `4000-ACCTFILE-PROC` | Processes operations (open, read, close) for the `ACCT-FILE`. |
| `4900-EXIT` | Sets the return code based on the file status of `ACCT-FILE` and branches to the end of the `4000-ACCTFILE-PROC` section. |
| `4999-EXIT` | Exits the `4000-ACCTFILE-PROC` section. |
