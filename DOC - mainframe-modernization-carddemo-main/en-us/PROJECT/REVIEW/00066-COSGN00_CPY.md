## Technical Analysis Review

**File:**  \COSGN00.CPY

**Title:**  Common Sign-On Information Structure (Based on naming conventions)

**Summary:** 

This code defines two COBOL data structures, COSGN0AI and COSGN0AO, likely used for handling sign-on or authentication information across different systems or programs.  The structures store various data points such as transaction names, titles, dates, times, user IDs, passwords, and error messages.  The REDEFINES clause suggests the structures might handle data in different formats or from different sources.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL 
* **Framework/Library:** `Not available`
* **Database:**  While there's no direct database interaction within this code snippet, the presence of fields like USERIDI, PASSWDI, and ERRMSGI suggests potential interaction with a system or database that requires authentication and returns error messages.
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`
