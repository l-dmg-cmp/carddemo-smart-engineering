**Title:**  Account Statement Generator

**Summary:** 

This COBOL program generates account statements by processing data from multiple input files. It reads transaction details, customer information, and account data to produce statements in both plain text and HTML formats. The program utilizes various COBOL features, including control block addressing, ALTER and GO TO statements, COMP and COMP-3 variables, 2-dimensional arrays, and subroutine calls.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL
* **Framework/Library:**  `Not available`
* **Database:** `Not available` 
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`

**Reference, Class and Method:**

| Reference | Description |
|---|---|
| COSTM01 |  This copy statement likely brings in a library or code block defining common constants or variables. |
| CVACT03Y | This copy statement likely brings in a library or code block defining layouts or structures related to account activity. |
| CUSTREC | This likely defines the layout for customer records. |
| CVACT01Y | Similar to CVACT03Y, this could define more account activity-related data structures. |

| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| `Not available` |  |

| Method(Public) | Description |
|---|---|
| `CBSTM03B` |  A subroutine (or possibly an external program) invoked to perform file operations (open, read, close).  It receives the `WS-M03B-AREA` data structure to control its actions and return results. |

| Method(Private) | Description |
|---|---|
| `0000-START` |  Initial program logic, evaluating a file identifier and branching to specific file opening routines. |
| `1000-MAINLINE` | The main processing loop, orchestrating the reading of data from different files and generating statements. |
| `1000-XREFFILE-GET-NEXT` | Reads the next record from the XREFFILE. |
| `2000-CUSTFILE-GET` | Retrieves customer data from CUSTFILE based on a key. |
| `3000-ACCTFILE-GET` | Fetches account information from ACCTFILE using a key. |
| `4000-TRNXFILE-GET` |  Processes transactions from TRNXFILE, likely for a specific account. |
| `5000-CREATE-STATEMENT` |  Initializes and populates the statement data, including customer and account details. |
| `5100-WRITE-HTML-HEADER` |  Writes the HTML header section of the statement. |
| `5100-EXIT` | Exit point for the 5100-WRITE-HTML-HEADER section. |
| `5200-WRITE-HTML-NMADBS` |  Writes HTML for customer name, address, and basic account details. |
| `5200-EXIT` | Exit point for the 5200-WRITE-HTML-NMADBS section. |
| `6000-WRITE-TRANS` |  Formats and writes individual transaction details to the statement. |
| `8100-FILE-OPEN` |  A placeholder or intermediate section for file opening, redirecting to the appropriate file open routine based on the value of `WS-FL-DD`. |
| `8100-TRNXFILE-OPEN` |  Opens the TRNXFILE for reading transaction data. |
| `8200-XREFFILE-OPEN` |  Opens the XREFFILE. |
| `8300-CUSTFILE-OPEN` |  Opens the CUSTFILE. |
| `8400-ACCTFILE-OPEN` |  Opens the ACCTFILE. |
| `8500-READTRNX-READ` |  Reads and processes transaction records from the TRNXFILE. |
| `8599-EXIT` | Exit point for the 8500-READTRNX-READ section. |
| `9100-TRNXFILE-CLOSE` |  Closes the TRNXFILE. |
| `9200-XREFFILE-CLOSE` |  Closes the XREFFILE. |
| `9300-CUSTFILE-CLOSE` |  Closes the CUSTFILE. |
| `9400-ACCTFILE-CLOSE` |  Closes the ACCTFILE. |
| `9999-GOBACK` |  Final program termination point (GOBACK). |
| `9999-ABEND-PROGRAM` |  Error handling routine, displaying messages and likely terminating abnormally (using CEE3ABD). |
