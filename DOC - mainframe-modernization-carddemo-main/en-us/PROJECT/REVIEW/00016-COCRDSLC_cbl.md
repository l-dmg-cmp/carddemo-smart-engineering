**Title:**  Credit Card Detail Selection

**Summary:** 

This COBOL program serves as the business logic layer for processing credit card detail requests within what appears to be a larger CICS online transaction processing (OLTP) system.  The program interacts with a user interface (likely a 3270 terminal screen) to gather account and card information, validates the input, retrieves card details from a VSAM file (CARDDAT) potentially indexed by account (CARDAIX), and displays the results. 

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL
* **Framework/Library:** CICS (Customer Information Control System)
* **Database:**
  * **VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method):** Inferred from the use of file handling verbs like `READ` and file names like "CARDDAT."  
* **Others Tools:** `Not available`

| Method(Public) | Description |
|---|---|
| `0000-MAIN` |  Main program logic. Handles initialization, input processing, data retrieval, and screen interactions. |
| `COMMON-RETURN` |  Common return point for exiting the program. Sets up the communication area and issues a CICS RETURN command. |
| `1000-SEND-MAP` |  Orchestrates the process of sending the credit card search screen to the user. |
| `1100-SCREEN-INIT` |  Initializes screen fields with default values and retrieves the current date and time. |
| `1200-SETUP-SCREEN-VARS` |  Sets up screen variables based on the program's context and input data. |
| `1300-SETUP-SCREEN-ATTRS` |  Configures screen attributes, including field protection, cursor position, and color based on validation results. |
| `1400-SEND-SCREEN` |  Issues the CICS SEND MAP command to display the screen to the user.  |
| `2000-PROCESS-INPUTS` |  Manages the processing of user input from the screen. |
| `2100-RECEIVE-MAP` |  Issues the CICS RECEIVE MAP command to retrieve user input from the screen. |
| `2200-EDIT-MAP-INPUTS` |  Performs validation on the user-entered account and card numbers. |
| `2210-EDIT-ACCOUNT` |  Validates the account number entered by the user. |
| `2220-EDIT-CARD` |  Validates the card number entered by the user. |
| `9000-READ-DATA` |  Controls the data retrieval logic based on the provided account and card number. |
| `9100-GETCARD-BYACCTCARD` |  Reads card data from the CARDDAT file using the card number as the key. |
| `9150-GETCARD-BYACCT` |  Reads card data from the CARDDAT file using the account number as the key (likely through an alternate index). |
| `SEND-LONG-TEXT` |  Sends a long text message to the user (likely for debugging). |
| `SEND-PLAIN-TEXT` |  Sends a plain text message to the user (likely for debugging). |
| `ABEND-ROUTINE` |  Handles abnormal program terminations (abends). Logs error information and terminates the program. |
