**Title:**  Interest Calculator Program

**Summary:** 

This COBOL program calculates and applies interest to customer accounts. It reads transaction and account information from indexed files, computes interest based on predefined rates, updates account balances, and writes transaction records. The program handles cases where specific account or disclosure group information is missing, offering default handling.

**Technology:**

* **Programming Language:** COBOL
* **Framework/Library:** `Not available`
* **Database:**  This program interacts with indexed files, suggesting a file-based data storage system. While the specific system isn't named, the use of indexed access hints at VSAM, ISAM, or similar.
* **Others Tools:** 
  * **IBM Mainframe:** The use of COBOL and indexed file processing strongly suggests an IBM mainframe environment.
  * **DB2 (Possible):** The presence of a timestamp formatting routine (`Z-GET-DB2-FORMAT-TIMESTAMP`) implies potential interaction with a DB2 database, though it's not directly used for data retrieval or updates within the provided code.

| Method(Public) | Description |
|---|---|
| `0000-TCATBALF-OPEN` | Opens the Transaction Category Balance File (`TCATBAL-FILE`) for input. |
| `0100-XREFFILE-OPEN` | Opens the Cross-Reference File (`XREF-FILE`) for input. |
| `0200-DISCGRP-OPEN` | Opens the Disclosure Group File (`DISCGRP-FILE`) for input. |
| `0300-ACCTFILE-OPEN` | Opens the Account Master File (`ACCOUNT-FILE`) for input and output (I-O). |
| `0400-TRANFILE-OPEN` | Opens the Transaction File (`TRANSACT-FILE`) for output. |
| `1000-TCATBALF-GET-NEXT` | Reads the next record from the Transaction Category Balance File (`TCATBAL-FILE`). |
| `1050-UPDATE-ACCOUNT` | Updates the Account Master File (`ACCOUNT-FILE`) with calculated interest and resets cycle credit/debit. |
| `1100-GET-ACCT-DATA` | Retrieves account data from the Account Master File (`ACCOUNT-FILE`) based on account ID. |
| `1110-GET-XREF-DATA` | Retrieves data from the Cross-Reference File (`XREF-FILE`) using the account ID as the key. |
| `1200-GET-INTEREST-RATE` | Reads interest rate information from the Disclosure Group File (`DISCGRP-FILE`). Handles missing records by attempting to use a default group code. |
| `1200-A-GET-DEFAULT-INT-RATE` | Reads the default interest rate from the Disclosure Group File (`DISCGRP-FILE`) using the 'DEFAULT' group code. |
| `1300-COMPUTE-INTEREST` | Calculates monthly interest based on the transaction category balance and the retrieved interest rate. |
| `1300-B-WRITE-TX` | Constructs and writes transaction records to the Transaction File (`TRANSACT-FILE`) with details of the calculated interest. |
| `1400-COMPUTE-FEES` | Placeholder for future implementation of fee computation logic. |
| `9000-TCATBALF-CLOSE` | Closes the Transaction Category Balance File (`TCATBAL-FILE`). |
| `9100-XREFFILE-CLOSE` | Closes the Cross-Reference File (`XREF-FILE`). |
| `9200-DISCGRP-CLOSE` | Closes the Disclosure Group File (`DISCGRP-FILE`). |
| `9300-ACCTFILE-CLOSE` | Closes the Account Master File (`ACCOUNT-FILE`). |
| `9400-TRANFILE-CLOSE` | Closes the Transaction File (`TRANSACT-FILE`). |
| `Z-GET-DB2-FORMAT-TIMESTAMP` |  Formats the current date and time into a DB2 timestamp format. |
| `9999-ABEND-PROGRAM` |  Aborts the program in case of a fatal error. |
| `9910-DISPLAY-IO-STATUS` |  Displays formatted file status information. |
