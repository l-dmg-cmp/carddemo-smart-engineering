**Title:**  Conditional Screen Field Attribute Setting (Based on File Contents)

**Summary:** 

This code snippet appears to be part of a larger program (likely written in COBOL or a similar mainframe language) that manages screen displays, possibly for a financial transaction system. Its primary function is to set the color attribute of a screen field named `(SCRNVAR2)` within a map or display template (`(MAPNAME3)`). The color is set to red ("DFHRED") if a specific condition related to a variable or flag (`(TESTVAR1)`) is met, indicating an error. Additionally, if the flag indicates the field is blank, an asterisk ("*") is placed in the field.
